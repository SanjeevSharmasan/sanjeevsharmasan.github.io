Building Micro-Tools for Order-to-Cash Excellence

After 12+ years optimizing $500M+ of finance operations at Cargill, I identified a critical market gap: finance teams struggle with fragmented O2C solutions but no targeted micro-tools exist.

CashFlow Labs is changing that by building focused solutions for the 5 pillars of Order-to-Cash:

1️⃣ INVOICE INTELLIGENCE
Problem: Manual data entry, format variations, SKU matching errors
Solution: AI-powered invoice recognition & automated PO-Receipt-Invoice matching
Target Impact: 85-90% manual effort reduction

2️⃣ CREDIT RISK ENGINE
Problem: Credit teams making decisions on outdated data
Solution: ML-based real-time credit scoring & risk assessment
Target Impact: 30-40% bad debt reduction

3️⃣ COLLECTIONS OPTIMIZATION
Problem: Collections teams lack data science—calling randomly without strategy
Solution: AI predicts optimal contact time, payment terms, collection strategies
Target Impact: DSO reduction of 8-12 days

4️⃣ CASH APPLICATION AUTOMATION
Problem: Manual matching causes cash visibility delays
Solution: Intelligent matching with exception-based review workflows
Target Impact: 90%+ auto-clearance rate

5️⃣ BILLING & DISPUTE MANAGER
Problem: Disputes take 30-90 days to resolve
Solution: Automated dispute matching & resolution workflows
Target Impact: 50% faster resolution

📊 Current Status:
✓ Market validation complete (20+ finance leaders interviewed)
✓ MVP in development for Invoice Intelligence (Q1 2026 launch)
✓ Building pilot partnerships
✓ Actively seeking early adopters

🎯 Ideal Pilot Partners:
→ $500M-$10B revenue companies
→ Struggling with O2C efficiency
→ Tech-forward & open to innovation
→ $50K-$200K software budget

The Gap Story:
This wasn't a break from career. It was an intentional founder move. After solving O2C for one company (Cargill), I realized I could build solutions helping thousands.

## ✅ STEP 7: FIRST LINKEDIN POST (DO THIS TOMORROW)

**Copy & Paste this post:**

```
August 2025: I resigned from Cargill.

Not because I was burned out.
Not because I had a disagreement.

Because I saw an opportunity nobody else was building for.

For 12 years, I led order-to-cash transformations at Cargill. Every single project had the same problem:

Finance teams have 5 distinct O2C challenges:
1. Invoice processing (manual, error-prone)
2. Credit decisions (based on outdated data)
3. Collections strategy (no data science)
4. Cash matching (slow, manual)
5. Dispute handling (month-long cycles)

But nobody builds FOR these specific problems.

They build "solutions" that try to do everything.
Which means they do nothing well.

So I'm building what finance teams actually need:
→ 5 micro-tools
→ Each solving ONE problem
→ Each obsessively focused on that one job

Today: MVP for problem #1 is in development
Next 60 days: First pilot partners onboarded
Next 6 months: Launch solutions for pillars 2-5

If your company spends time on manual invoice processing, struggling with DSO, or dealing with slow credit approvals—you're my exact target customer.

CashFlow Labs. Built by someone who's solved O2C at scale before.

Let's talk.

```
Hi [Name],

I've moved to something new that I wanted to share with you.

After 12 years at Cargill optimizing finance operations (and seeing consistent patterns across multiple GCC centers), I left to start CashFlow Labs.

We're building micro-tools for the Order-to-Cash challenges that every enterprise finance team faces:
- Manual invoice processing
- DSO/Collections optimization  
- Credit risk management
- Cash application bottlenecks
- Dispute resolution cycles

I'm actively looking for pilot partners starting Q1 2026.

Does your company experience any of these challenges? If so, I'd love to spend 20 minutes understanding your O2C pain points.

Open to connecting?

Best,
Sanjeev
