I left Cargill in August 2025 to solve the 3 pillars that impact cash flow most:

🎯 COLLECTIONS OPTIMIZATION
Problem: DSO 45-60 days (millions tied up in receivables)
Solution: AI predicts optimal collection strategies per customer
Impact: 8-12 day DSO reduction = $10M-$100M freed up

🎯 CREDIT RISK SCORING

Solution: Real-time ML credit scoring engine
Impact: Instant decisions, 30-40% bad debt reduction

🎯 CASH APPLICATION AUTOMATION
Problem: Manual matching delays cash visibility 2-3 weeks
Solution: AI-powered matching with 90%+ auto-clearance
Impact: Real-time cash visibility, working capital unlocked

BACKGROUND:
→ 12+ years finance operations & GCC leadership at Cargill
→ $500M+ order-to-cash processes transformed

🎯 Building AI Solutions for the 3 Most Critical O2C Pillars

After 12+ years at Cargill transforming Order-to-Cash processes at scale, I identified the 3 highest-ROI opportunities where AI + automation create immediate cash flow impact:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ COLLECTIONS OPTIMIZATION ENGINE

PROBLEM:
- DSO: 45-60 days (enterprise average)
- Root cause: Collections strategies are reactive, not data-driven
- Impact: $10M-$100M+ locked up per company

SOLUTION:
- AI predicts optimal collection timing & strategy per customer
- Real-time dashboards showing collection effectiveness
- Auto-segmentation based on customer behavior patterns
- Integrated payment plan workflows

MVP STATUS: In development | Q1 2026 launch
TARGET IMPACT: 8-12 day DSO reduction ($10M-$100M freed up)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

2️⃣ CREDIT RISK SCORING PLATFORM

PROBLEM:
- Credit decisions: 3-5 days (slow, delays deals)
- Root cause: Spreadsheets + gut feel (no data science)
- Bad debt: 2-3% of portfolio (preventable)
- Impact: $5-15M bad debt + missed sales

SOLUTION:
- Real-time ML credit scoring engine
- Ingests 100+ data points (financials, history, industry, macro)
- Auto-approval for low-risk (instant decisions)
- Escalation for high-value (expert review only)
- Continuous learning (improves over time)

MVP STATUS: Architecture complete | Q1 2026 launch
TARGET IMPACT: Instant decisions, 30-40% bad debt reduction

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

3️⃣ CASH APPLICATION AUTOMATION

PROBLEM:
- Cash matching: 2-3 weeks (manual process)
- Root cause: Complex payment structures, manual reconciliation
- Impact: $5-50M+ in "in-transit" cash, forecast errors

SOLUTION:
- AI-powered intelligent matching engine
- 90%+ auto-clearance (no human needed)
- Exception handling for complex cases
- Real-time cash visibility dashboard
- Integration with existing ERPs/systems

MVP STATUS: Core algorithm complete | Q2 2026 launch
TARGET IMPACT: Real-time cash visibility, $5-25M working capital freed

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 💡 30-SECOND ELEVATOR PITCH
```
"I'm Sanjeev. Founder of CashFlow Labs.

I spent 12 years at Cargill transforming order-to-cash processes.
Automated $500M+. Saved $8-10M annually. 85-95% efficiency gains.

Realized this exact problem affects every enterprise.

So I'm building CashFlow Labs—AI solutions for the 3 things that matter most:
Collections (DSO reduction), Credit (instant decisions), Cash Apps (real-time visibility).

MVP launches Q1 2026. We're seeking pilot partners now.

Does your company struggle with DSO or cash visibility?"
```

## 60-SECOND ELEVATOR PITCH
```
"Hi, I'm Sanjeev. I'm the founder of CashFlow Labs.

For the last 12 years, I worked at Cargill's Global Business Services center, 
leading massive finance transformations. We automated $500M+ of Order-to-Cash processes, 
cut costs by $8-10M annually, and achieved 85-95% automation rates.

But here's what I learned: every company has the exact same 3 problems:

1. Collections is stuck in the 1990s (DSO 45-60 days, millions stuck)
2. Credit approvals take 3-5 days (slows sales, bad debt 2-3%)
3. Cash matching is manual (2-3 week visibility delays, forecast errors)

So I left Cargill in August to start CashFlow Labs. 
We're building AI solutions for these 3 pillars.

We're launching Q1 2026 and actively looking for pilot partners.

If your company struggles with high DSO, credit bottlenecks, or cash visibility, let's talk.
I've solved this problem at scale before. I can help you do it too."

## 📧 OUTREACH MESSAGE TEMPLATE

```
Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because [Company] caught my attention, and I think there's a fit.

I recently left Cargill (where I led $500M+ order-to-cash transformations) 
to start CashFlow Labs—building AI solutions for the Order-to-Cash challenges 
every finance team faces.

Specifically, I'm interested in companies struggling with:
✓ High DSO (45-60 days is typical)
✓ Slow credit approvals (3-5 days bottlenecks sales)
✓ Manual cash matching (poor visibility, forecast errors)

Given [Company's] scale, I'm guessing at least one of these is a pain point.

Would you have 20 minutes for a quick call to see if there's a fit?

Best,
Sanjeev

## 📝 LINKEDIN POST #1: WHY DSO KILLS CASH FLOW

```
CFOs are losing sleep over this one metric: DSO.

Days Sales Outstanding.

Here's the reality:
• Average DSO: 45-60 days
• Translation: $100M in revenue = $12-20M stuck in receivables
• It stays stuck without intentional action

I spent 12 years at Cargill solving this.

Here's what I learned:

Collections isn't broken. It's stuck in a 1990s playbook:
❌ Call customers at random times
❌ With no data on what works
❌ Track results in spreadsheets
❌ Celebrate any improvement as a win

Better approach?

👉 Predict which customers are likely to pay
👉 Optimize contact timing based on customer behavior
👉 Segment strategies (not one-size-fits-all)
👉 Measure results in real-time

Result? 8-12 days DSO reduction.

For a $500M company: $5-10M freed up working capital.

That's not incremental. That's transformation.

We're building this at CashFlow Labs. Q1 2026.

## 📝 LINKEDIN POST #2: THE CREDIT APPROVAL PARADOX

```
Sales: "Can we take on this customer?"

Credit: "Let me check... 3-5 days"

Meanwhile the customer is gone.

To your competitor.

This scenario plays out 10,000x daily across enterprises.

And it costs millions:
→ Deals lost to faster competitors
→ Bad debt from rushed approvals
→ Opportunity cost of delay
→ Relationships damaged

Why? Because credit hasn't evolved.

At Cargill, we changed this.

Instead of:
❌ Manual spreadsheets
❌ Multiple approval layers
❌ 3-5 day decisions

We built:
✅ Real-time ML credit scoring
✅ Auto-approval for low-risk
✅ Expert review for high-value only
✅ Instant decisions

Result?
→ Sales closures improved 15-20%
→ Bad debt dropped 30-40%
→ Customer satisfaction increased

Now I'm building this solution at CashFlow Labs.

The world doesn't need another credit rating agency.
It needs real-time credit decisions.

When was the last time your credit team approved something in under 2 hours?

Comment. Let's talk about this.

## 📝 LINKEDIN POST #3: THE CASH VISIBILITY PROBLEM

```
How much cash does your company have RIGHT NOW?

Can you answer that? Truly?

Most CFOs can't.

Why? Because cash application is manual.

Here's the reality:
• Customer pays Friday
• You match it to invoices Tuesday
• Your cash position was wrong all weekend
• Forecast is now inaccurate
• Treasury team is frustrated

At Cargill, we solved this.

Problem: Manual matching takes 2-3 weeks

Solution: AI-powered cash application
✓ 90%+ auto-clearance (no human needed)
✓ Instant visibility (real-time dashboard)
✓ Exception handling (complex cases handled)
✓ Working capital freed ($5-50M+ typical)

Result: Real-time cash visibility. Always accurate.

This shouldn't be revolutionary. It should be standard.

We're building this at CashFlow Labs.

Q1 2026 launch. Pilots open now.

## 📝 LINKEDIN POST #4: WHY I LEFT CARGILL IN AUGUST

```
I left Cargill in August 2025.

Not because I was burned out.
Not because I had a disagreement.

Because I saw an opportunity nobody else was building for.

For 12 years, I led order-to-cash transformations at Cargill. 
Every single project revealed the same pattern:

Three things that hurt cash flow:
1. Collections is reactive (DSO 45-60 days)
2. Credit decisions are slow (3-5 days)
3. Cash matching is manual (2-3 week delays)

Every company I talked to faced these same 3 challenges.

But nobody was building focused solutions.

They build bloated ERPs that do everything (and nothing well).
Or disconnected point solutions that don't work together.

So I left to start CashFlow Labs.

We're building 3 focused, AI-powered solutions:
→ Collections optimization (DSO reduction)
→ Real-time credit scoring
→ Intelligent cash application

Each one solves one problem exceptionally well.

MVP launches Q1 2026.

Why am I telling you this?

Because if you're in finance operations, you need to know:
✅ Better solutions are coming
✅ The old way doesn't have to be the only way
✅ Your cash flow challenges have solutions

And if you're thinking about building something yourself:
✅ Leaving security was the best decision I made
✅ Solving real problems for real customers is better than any job
✅ The market wants what you're building

Let's connect if you're in finance ops or thinking about startups.

## 🎯 KEY MESSAGES FOR CONVERSATIONS

**When someone asks: "What are you working on?"**
```
"I'm building AI solutions for the 3 pillars of Order-to-Cash that impact cash flow most:
Collections (DSO reduction), Credit (instant decisions), and Cash Applications (real-time visibility).

After solving these problems at Cargill for $500M+ processes, I realized every enterprise has the same challenges.

We're launching Q1 2026. Seeking pilot partners."
```

**When someone asks: "Why these 3 pillars?"**
```
"Because they have the highest ROI and the least saturation:

Collections: DSO improvement directly frees up millions. No other vendor has cracked this with AI.

Credit: Companies desperately want instant decisions. Real-time scoring is becoming table stakes.

Cash Apps: The most underserved. Everyone suffers with manual matching, but no one's built an AI solution.

These 3 are interconnected in cash flow. Solve them, and you transform the entire O2C."
```

**When someone asks: "What's your timeline?"**
```
"Collections MVP: Q1 2026 (currently in testing)
Credit MVP: Q1 2026 (architecture complete, building now)
Cash Apps MVP: Q2 2026 (core algorithm done, integration phase)

All 3 are in active development. We're selecting 5 founding customers now for pilots.

If you're interested, let's talk."
```

**When someone asks: "What's the pitch?"**
```
"Every enterprise finance team struggles with:
- Millions tied up in receivables (DSO too high)
- Credit decisions slowing down sales (approval bottlenecks)
- Cash visibility delays (forecast accuracy issues)

We solve these 3 problems with AI. Real ROI. Immediate impact.

Not a big suite of tools. 3 focused solutions that work together.

Q1 2026 launch. Looking for partners."
