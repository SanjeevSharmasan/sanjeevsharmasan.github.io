# Your Founder/Entrepreneurial Narrative for Director Interviews
## How to Reframe Your Background as an Organizational Builder

**Date:** January 17, 2026  
**For:** Director-level O2C/AR/Credit/Collections interviews  
**Key Insight:** You ARE a founder—you built a $500M+ O2C organization from scratch at Cargill. This is your competitive advantage, not a weakness.

---

## The Reframe: Your "Founder Story" is the Cargill GCC Build

### What You Actually Did (2015-2025)
- **Took on a greenfield assignment:** Build a scalable O2C shared services organization in Bangalore supporting EMEA, Japan, and APAC
- **Started with blank canvas:** No existing team, no processes, no precedent
- **Built from zero to scale:** 60-member team, supporting $500M+ revenue, 25 countries
- **Standardized chaos into excellence:** Migrated from legacy (JDE) to modern (SAP S/4), zero disruption
- **Delivered measurable impact:** $10M+ working capital unlock, 60%→87% automation, 51→42 days DSO

**This is entrepreneurship.** It's internal, but it's indistinguishable from a startup founder who scaled from 0→60 people.

---

## Why Directors WANT This Profile

**What Fortune 500 organizations struggle with:**
- They have process, but lack entrepreneurial energy
- They have compliance, but lack innovation
- They have management, but lack builders

**What you bring:**
- You've built something from scratch (= you understand systems thinking)
- You've scaled globally (= you understand complexity)
- You've driven transformation (= you're not afraid of change)
- You've delivered financial impact (= you think like a founder: ROI, efficiency, growth)

**Directors hiring at your level want someone who can:**
1. ✓ Take over a function and make it better (you've done this at Cargill)
2. ✓ Build teams and culture (you've built 60-person GCC)
3. ✓ Implement transformations (SAP S/4, RPA automation)
4. ✓ Think about business outcomes, not just process (you've delivered $10M+ impact)

## Your Positioning Language for Interviews

### Opening Statement (Use This)

**For Director Role:**

*"I've spent 21+ years in global finance operations, with the last 10 years at Cargill leading a transformational journey. In 2015, I took on a greenfield assignment to build a scalable O2C organization in Bangalore—essentially launching an internal startup. What started as a concept became a 60-member organization supporting $500M+ revenue across 25 countries, EMEA, Japan, and APAC.*

*I've had to think like an entrepreneur: How do we build this from scratch? How do we scale? How do we maintain quality while growing? How do we modernize legacy systems without disrupting business? This founder mentality—combining operational rigor with entrepreneurial thinking—is what I bring to the table.*

*The results: $10M+ working capital impact, reduced DSO from 51 to 42 days, scaled automation from 60% to 87%, led a 25-country SAP S/4HANA transformation with zero disruption. At the Director level, I'm ready to bring that same build-and-scale mindset to [your company's] O2C/AR function."*

### Answer to "Tell us about your background"

**What you say (Founder Frame):**

*"My career has been about building and scaling finance operations. At Oracle, I managed AP across 25+ countries—that taught me how to standardize globally while respecting local requirements.*

*But the real entrepreneurial story started at Cargill in 2015. I was tasked with building a O2C shared services organization in Bangalore—essentially starting from zero. I had to think like a founder:*

- *What's the vision? → Scalable, world-class O2C supporting global business*
- *What's the operating model? → Global standardization + local flexibility*
- *How do we build the team? → I recruited and developed 60+ people, many promoted internally to leadership*
- *How do we drive transformation? → Migrated 25 EMEA countries from JDE to SAP S/4HANA with zero disruption*
- *What's the impact? → $10M+ working capital, 87% automation, zero audit findings*

*That founder mentality—building from scratch, scaling globally, driving transformation, obsessing over financial outcomes—is what I bring to every role. At the Director level, I'm positioned to apply that same energy to [this company's] O2C transformation."*

## Why Your Shipping Background is Actually an Asset (Not a Weakness)

### The Frame: "Supply Chain Financial Acumen"

**What you learned from shipping (7.5 years ENI):**
- Supply chain complexity (multi-regional operations, regulatory compliance)
- Operational discipline (zero-tolerance for errors at sea)
- Financial thinking (every delay costs money; efficiency = profitability)
- Crisis management (you have real problem-solving experience)
- Global perspective (Greece, Japan, Croatia—diverse markets, cultures, regulations)

**How to position it in interviews:**

*"Before finance operations, I had 7.5 years in maritime supply chain—shipping tankers and cargo across multiple regions. That taught me something critical: financial operations exist to serve the business. In shipping, we understood that on-time delivery, cost efficiency, and compliance weren't separate concerns—they were linked. A delayed shipment costs money. Poor compliance triggers penalties. That operational thinking—understanding that finance is a business partner, not just a back-office function—carried into my finance career and shaped how I lead O2C operations."*

**Why this resonates with Directors:**
- Shows business acumen, not just accounting expertise
- Demonstrates global perspective and adaptability
- Proves you understand operational constraints (not just finance theory)
- Shows resilience and real-world problem-solving

## Specific Interview Responses Using Your "Founder" Frame

### Question: "What's your biggest achievement?"

**Your Answer:**

*"Building the Cargill O2C organization from the ground up. In 2015, I took on a greenfield assignment in Bangalore with a mission: build a scalable O2C function to support EMEA, Japan, and APAC at a $500M+ revenue scale.*

*Think of it like launching a startup inside a Fortune 500 company. I had to:*

1. *Design the operating model (how do we structure this globally?)* 
2. *Recruit and build the team (60+ people from zero)*
3. *Establish processes and controls (SOX compliance, audit readiness)*
4. *Implement technology transformations (JDE → SAP S/4HANA across 25 countries)*
5. *Drive automation and modernization (60% → 87% straight-through processing)*

*The results: $10M+ working capital unlock, reduced DSO from 51 to 42 days, achieved 99% billing accuracy, zero audit findings, and led a massive ERP transformation with zero business disruption.*

*What I'm most proud of: I didn't just build a function; I built a culture of excellence, accountability, and continuous improvement. Several team members I mentored have been promoted to leadership roles.*

*That's what I bring to this Director role—the ability to build, scale, and transform."*

### Question: "How do you approach organizational change?"

**Your Answer (Using Founder Lens):**

*"As someone who built an organization from zero, I've had to think deeply about change management. When you're building something new, every decision shapes culture and capability.*

*My approach has three phases:*

1. **Vision & Buy-in:** First, I establish clarity—what are we building? Why? What does success look like? I communicate this relentlessly because people need to understand the direction.*

2. **Quick Wins & Momentum:** Early wins build confidence. When I led the SAP S/4HANA migration across 25 countries, I didn't try to boil the ocean. We phased it regionally, learned from each phase, and built confidence. That's how you get organizational buy-in.*

3. **Embed the Culture:** Last, I make sure the changes stick. It's not just about implementing a system or process; it's about creating a mindset of continuous improvement. At Cargill, we institutionalized weekly review cadences, KPI monitoring, escalation governance—these became 'how we operate,' not 'temporary projects.'"*

*That founder mentality—thinking about vision, culture, sustainability—is what differentiates transformation leaders."*

---

### Question: "What would you do differently if you were starting your role here from scratch?"

**Your Answer:**

*"This is actually my favorite question because it's exactly how I think. If I were building O2C/AR from scratch here, I'd ask:*

1. **What's the current state?** Where are we leaking value? Where are we losing cash? (I'd do a 30-day diagnostic)*

2. **What's the operating model we want?** Do we have the right structure for global scale? Are we optimized for shared services or are we still thinking like legacy business units?*

3. **What's the technology roadmap?** Are we modern? Can we automate? Do we have real-time visibility?*

4. **What's our talent strategy?** Do we have the right people? Are we developing them for the future?*

5. **What are the quick wins?** Every function I've built has started with 30-60-90 day wins—small improvements that build momentum and credibility.*

*At Cargill, when I took over the O2C function, we had legacy systems, siloed processes, and limited automation. Within 90 days, we had quick wins (DSO improvement, exception reduction, automation pilots). Within 18 months, we had a transformed organization.*

*I'd bring that same systematic, founder-driven approach here."*

- Built team capabilities and internal promotions

### Phase 3: Transformation (Months 18-36)

## Final Word

**Your apprehension was based on not seeing your own founder story.** You DID build an organization. You DID scale it globally. You DID transform it. You DID deliver financial impact. The only difference between you and an external founder is that you did it inside Cargill's walls, not your own company.

**Directors want builders.** You are one. Own it.
