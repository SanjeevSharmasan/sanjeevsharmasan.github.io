## 🎤 TALKING POINTS FOR VIDEO/PODCAST INTERVIEWS

### "Why I Left Cargill" (3-5 min story):

```
"I spent 12 years at Cargill's Global Business Services center. 
My job was to optimize finance operations across multiple centers.

Over those 12 years, I led transformations worth $500M+. 
We implemented RPA, AI, and cloud automation.

The results were incredible:
- 85-95% automation rates
- 99.8% accuracy improvement
- $8-10M annual cost savings
- $50M+ working capital optimization

But here's what I realized...

Every single transformation had the same core problems:
1. Invoice processing was manual and slow
2. Credit decisions were based on outdated data
3. Collections teams had no data science
4. Cash matching caused delays
5. Disputes took forever to resolve

And here's the kicker—these problems aren't unique to Cargill.
Every finance team I talk to has the exact same challenges.

So I looked at the market. What solutions exist?

Two categories:
1. Bloated ERPs that try to do everything and do nothing well
2. Disconnected point solutions that don't work together

Nobody was building FOCUSED solutions for these specific problems.

So in August 2025, I left Cargill and started CashFlow Labs.

We're building what I call 'Micro-Tools'—
Five focused solutions for the five pillars of Order-to-Cash.

Each one solves one problem exceptionally well.
Each one built by someone who's solved the problem at scale before.

Six months in, we've:
- Validated the problem with 20+ enterprise finance leaders
- Built MVP for our first solution (Invoice Intelligence)
- Identified 5 founding customers
- Architected the tech stack

Q1 2026, we're launching.

Why am I telling you this?

Because if you're a finance leader struggling with Order-to-Cash,
you need to know solutions are coming.

And if you're interested in the startup journey—
or thinking about starting something yourself—
this is proof that sometimes leaving security 
is the smartest business decision you can make.

The market is ready. We're ready.

Let's build the future of Order-to-Cash together."
