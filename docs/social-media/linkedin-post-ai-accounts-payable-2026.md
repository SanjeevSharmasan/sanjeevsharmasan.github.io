**Headline:** AI for Accounts Payable 2026—Are We Ready? (Yes, If You Do This First)

**Body:**

Accounts Payable is ripe for AI-driven transformation in 2026. The technology is proven, the ROI is clear, and early adopters are already delivering 40-50% cost reductions and 50-70% cycle time improvements.

But here's the challenge: technology is only 30% of the equation. The real work is organizational readiness.

In my latest post, I break down:
- **High-ROI AP automation opportunities** (invoice capture, 3-way matching, payment optimization)
- **Organizational readiness checklist** (data quality, process standardization, stakeholder alignment, change management)
- **A phased 18-month implementation roadmap** (quick wins, core automation, intelligence layer)
- **Critical success factors and common pitfalls** to avoid

If you're leading AP transformation, this roadmap will help you move with confidence.
