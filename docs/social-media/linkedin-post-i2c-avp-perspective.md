📊 **Invoice-to-Cash Transformation: Leading I2C Excellence from AVP Perspective**

Are you ready to lead I2C transformation? 🚀

In my 21+ years of global finance leadership, I've learned that I2C optimization is no longer just a back-office efficiency play—it's a **strategic imperative** that directly impacts working capital, customer satisfaction, and business performance.

**Here's what separates best-in-class I2C operations from the rest:**

✅ **End-to-End Process Mastery**: Credit → Billing → Collections → Cash Application → Dispute Management
✅ **Data-Driven Decision Making**: KPIs like DSO, Collection Effectiveness, and Unapplied Cash
✅ **Cross-Functional Leadership**: Managing relationships across CFO, Sales, IT, and global operations teams
✅ **Technology Integration**: ERP implementations, automation, and digital transformation
✅ **Compliance & Controls**: SOX, revenue recognition, and audit trails—all integrated seamlessly

**The Impact?**
Organizations mastering their I2C cycles achieve:
• 15-25% reduction in Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)
• 5-10% recovery in disputed cash
• 20%+ improvement in customer satisfaction
• Significant working capital unlocking

**AVP-level I2C leadership requires:**
🎯 Analyzing complex processes and recommending improvements across people, process, and technology
🎯 Leading transformation projects with global stakeholder engagement
🎯 Establishing and monitoring KPI frameworks aligned with business strategy
🎯 Supporting change management across regions and cultures
🎯 Contributing thought leadership in the I2C space

I've just published a comprehensive guide on leading I2C excellence that covers:
• Strategic responsibilities of I2C leadership
• Performance management frameworks
• Stakeholder engagement at C-suite level
• Compliance and risk management
• Thought leadership opportunities

**What does best-in-class I2C look like in YOUR organization?**

I'd love to hear your perspectives on I2C transformation, technology adoption, and building high-performing global finance teams.
