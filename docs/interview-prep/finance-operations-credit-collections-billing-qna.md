## For Senior Manager & Director Level

---

### 1. CREDIT MANAGEMENT FUNDAMENTALS

**Q: Explain the credit management process end-to-end.**
A:
- **Credit Policy Development**:
  - Define credit limits: Based on customer financial strength, payment history
  - Pricing: Credit terms (Net 30, Net 60, etc.), early payment discounts
  - Collateral: When required (deposits, liens)
  - Industry standards: Different policies for different customer segments
  
- **Credit Approval Process**:
  1. Customer application: Financial statements, credit references
  2. Credit analysis: Assess ability to pay (liquidity, leverage, cash flow)
  3. Credit decision: Approve limit, set monitoring thresholds
  4. Documentation: Credit agreement, UCC filing if needed
  5. Monitoring: Regular review of financial health
  
- **Credit Limits**:
  - Dynamic: Adjust based on payment performance
  - Tiered: Small orders auto-approved, large orders need approval
  - Segment-based: Different limits for different customer types
  
- **Purpose**:
  - Minimize bad debt write-offs
  - Optimize credit availability (balance risk/revenue)
  - Speed order fulfillment (reduce approval delays)

**Q: What's your approach to credit analysis for new customers?**
A:
- **Financial Analysis**:
  - Income statement: Gross margin, EBITDA, profitability trends
  - Balance sheet: Current ratio (>1.5 is safe), debt-to-equity, inventory turnover
  - Cash flow: Operating cash flow (can customer actually generate cash?)
  - Trends: Last 3 years min, look for deterioration
  
- **External Factors**:
  - Industry: Mature industries safer than emerging
  - Competitive position: Market leader vs. struggling competitor
  - Management quality: Experienced team important
  
- **Credit Scoring**:
  - Dun & Bradstreet score: 0-100, higher is better
  - Bank references: Call bank, ask about account status
  - Payment history: Trade references, any late payments?
  - PAYDEX score: Predictive payment behavior (0-100+)
  
- **Decision Matrix**:
  - PAYDEX >80 + D&B >75: Auto-approve, standard terms
  - PAYDEX 60-79 + D&B 60-74: Approve with deposit or guarantee
  - PAYDEX <60 + D&B <60: Decline or very limited credit
  - New business (no history): COD or deposit until history established
  
- **Common Reasons to Decline**:
  - Poor payment history (consistent late payments)
  - Weak financials (negative cash flow, high leverage)
  - Industry stress (retailer in decline, tech startup unproven)
  - Personal guarantor is weak

**Q: Explain credit limits and monitoring thresholds.**
A:
- **Setting Limits**:
  - Formula: Annual revenue × (20-30%) = credit limit
  - Adjust by: Payment history, financial strength, industry
  - Segment approach: Small customers ($10K), mid-size ($100K), enterprise ($1M+)
  
- **Monitoring Thresholds**:
  - Outstanding balance: Alert when reaches 75%, 90% of limit
  - Aging: Alert if any invoices exceed payment terms (e.g., >Net 30)
  - Negative events: Late payment, NSF check, credit deterioration
  
- **Actions on Threshold Breach**:
  - 75% of limit: Send customer courtesy notice
  - 90% of limit: Hold new orders pending payment or limit increase
  - Aging >30 days: Initiate collection contact
  - NSF or significant late payment: Escalate to management, consider reducing limit

**Q: When do you require deposits or payment guarantees?**
A:
- **Deposit Situations**:
  - New customers: Until payment history established (3-6 months)
  - Weak credit profile: PAYDEX <70 or D&B <60
  - Large orders: Deposit for high-risk customers
  - Industry distress: Retailers during downturns
  - Special circumstances: Customer in bankruptcy protection
  
- **Deposit Amount**:
  - Standard: 20-50% of contract value
  - Risk-based: Higher % for higher risk
  - Refund policy: Typically refunded when account in good standing (90+ days payment)
  
- **Payment Guarantees**:
  - Personal guarantee: Owner guarantees customer's obligations
  - Parent company guarantee: Parent guarantees subsidiary's payment
  - Standby letter of credit: Bank guarantees (less common)
  - Collateral lien: UCC filing on assets
  
- **UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) Filing**:
  - Secures creditor's interest in customer assets
  - Gives priority in bankruptcy
  - Typical for large credit lines or equipment sales
  - File with state secretary of state

### 2. COLLECTIONS PROCESS & STRATEGY

**Q: Describe a comprehensive collections strategy.**
A:
- **Pre-Collections (Prevention)**:
  - Invoice quality: Clear payment terms, invoice address, company name
  - Customer communication: Send confirmations, delivery notices
  - Payment options: Multiple ways to pay (ACH, card, portal)
  - Incentives: Early payment discounts, streamlined payment process
  
- **At-Due Collections**:
  - Automated reminders: Email/SMS 1-2 days before due date
  - Friendly reminder: Not demanding, informational
  - Payment portal: Easy access for customer to pay
  
- **Past-Due Collections (0-30 Days)**:
  - Automated dunning: Email 1-5 days overdue
  - Tone: Professional but friendly, may be system error
  - Content: Invoice details, amount due, payment instructions
  - Frequency: Daily or every other day escalation
  
- **Aging Collections (30-90 Days)**:
  - Personal outreach: Phone call to AP/Finance contact
  - Escalation: Call manager if initial contact unresponsive
  - Investigation: Understand reason (dispute, cash issue, delivery problem)
  - Documentation: Notes in CRM, track all contacts
  - Payment plans: Offer installment arrangement if customer in distress
  
- **Aggressive Collections (90+ Days)**:
  - Executive escalation: Management involvement
  - Certified letter: Formal demand for payment
  - Legal consultation: Consider outside counsel or debt collector
  - Write-off evaluation: Assess collectability, consider bad debt allowance
  - Legal action: Last resort - lawsuit or claims against assets

**Q: How do you prioritize collections efforts?**
A:
- **Segmentation Strategy**:
  - **High-value accounts** (50% of AR value):
    - Personal contact from AP supervisor
    - Dedicated contact person
    - Daily tracking
    - Escalation to account executive if needed
  
  - **Mid-tier accounts** (30% of AR value):
    - Team collections contact
    - Weekly review
    - Dunning process + occasional personal contact
  
  - **Small accounts** (<$5K):
    - Automated dunning only
    - Quarterly review
    - Write-off at 120-180 days if uncollected
  
- **Priority Scoring**:
  - Amount × Age = Priority Score
  - Large, old amounts get highest priority
  - Example: $10K × 60 days = 600 points (high priority)
  
- **Collections Team Structure**:
  - Receivables team: Handle routine collections, 30-day aging
  - Collections specialists: Handle 30-90 day aging, negotiations
  - Management/legal: Handle 90+ days, legal matters

**Q: How do you handle customer disputes that delay payment?**
A:
- **Dispute Types**:
  - **Quantity Discrepancy**: Ordered 100, received 90
  - **Quality Issue**: Product defective or doesn't meet specs
  - **Price Disagreement**: Invoice amount differs from quote
  - **Delivery**: Late or partial delivery
  - **Service Issue**: Service not rendered as expected
  - **Billing Error**: Wrong customer, wrong date, duplicate
  
- **Dispute Resolution Process**:
  1. **Acknowledgment**: Record dispute, assign ticket number
  2. **Investigation**: 
     - Review order, delivery, invoice
     - Call warehouse, shipping, operations
     - Gather supporting documentation
  3. **Root Cause**: Determine actual cause
  4. **Resolution**:
     - **Operational Fix**: Send missing product, replace defective item
     - **Financial Remedy**: Credit memo for difference, full credit if return
     - **Negotiation**: Split difference for subjective issues
  5. **Payment**: Customer pays undisputed amount, disputes resolved separately
  6. **Follow-up**: Document, communicate resolution to customer
  
- **Best Practice**:
  - Don't hold ALL payment pending dispute resolution
  - Invoice $1000: $900 not in dispute → pay $900 now
  - $100 in dispute → customer pays when resolved
  - Speeds cash collection, maintains relationship

**Q: Explain dunning management and automation.**
A:
- **Dunning Process**:
  - Systematic escalation of payment reminders
  - Multiple channels: Email (primary), phone, SMS, letter
  - Escalating tone: Friendly → firm → legal
  
- **Dunning Strategy**:
  - Day 1: Automated email (system error notification)
  - Day 5: Second email (payment reminder)
  - Day 15: Third email (escalated tone)
  - Day 30: Phone call (personal contact)
  - Day 45: Management escalation
  - Day 60: Legal letter/outside agency
  
- **Dunning Automation Tools**:
  - SAP Collections Management
  - Dunning platforms: Billentis, Experian
  - CRM integration: Salesforce, HubSpot
  
- **Content Personalization**:
  - Pull customer name, invoice details, amount
  - Customize payment instructions (ACH, check, card)
  - Include invoice attachment
  - Offer payment plan for struggling customers

**Q: How do you handle write-offs and allowances?**
A:
- **Bad Debt Allowance**:
  - Estimate uncollectible AR (typically 0.5-2% of AR balance)
  - Calculate based on: Historical % of write-off, customer quality
  - Monthly journal entry: DR Bad Debt Expense, CR Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
  - Impact: Reduces reported AR, hits income statement
  
- **Write-off Process**:
  - Trigger: 180-210 days past due, reasonable collection efforts exhausted
  - Evaluation: Cost of further collection > potential recovery
  - Management approval: Required (audit requirement)
  - Documentation: Reasons for write-off, collection history, judgment
  - Journal entry: DR Allowance, CR AR (removes from balance sheet)
  - Tax: Only deductible if established as actually worthless
  
- **Post-Write-Off**:
  - Continue collection efforts (if customer situation improves)
  - If collected after write-off: Reverse write-off, post payment
  - Aging: Remove from aging reports once written off
  
- **Accounting Standards**:
  - **ASC 326**: Current GAAP for allowance estimation
  - Expected credit loss model (vs. incurred loss model)
  - Must estimate probability-weighted outcomes

**Q: Describe how to reduce DSO from 45 to 30 days.**
A:
- **Current State Analysis**:
  - Calculate current DSO: (AR balance ÷ Daily revenue) = Days
  - Analyze aging: What % is 30/60/90+ days?
  - Root causes: Invoicing delays? Collections delays? Customer quality?
  
- **Quick Wins (1-3 months)**:
  - **Invoicing Speed**: Currently invoice at delivery → Invoice at shipment
    - Saves 2-5 days
    - Impact: If invoice on day 5 instead of day 10, DSO drops 5 days
  
  - **Automated Dunning**: Implement email dunning at 1/5/15 days
    - Remove manual delays
    - Consistent customer outreach
    - Impact: 5-7 day improvement
  
  - **Payment Options**: Add ACH, credit card payment
    - Easier for customer
    - Faster receipt
    - Impact: 3-5 day improvement
  
  - **Top Account Management**: Personal contact for top 20 customers (50% of AR)
    - Build relationships
    - Understand needs
    - Impact: 3-5 day improvement on large accounts
  
- **Medium-term (3-6 months)**:
  - **Collections Staffing**: Add resources, improve efficiency
  - **Incentives**: Offer early pay discount (1% discount if paid in 10 days)
  - **Process Standardization**: Same invoice format, payment address
  - **Customer Segmentation**: Different terms for different risk profiles
  
- **Long-term (6-12 months)**:
  - **System Upgrade**: Implement SAP S/4HANA with real-time analytics
  - **Advance Billing**: For subscription customers, invoice at start of period
  - **Supply Chain Finance**: Offer discounting for early payment
  - **Customer Quality**: Shift mix toward creditworthy customers
  
- **Expected Results**: 15-day DSO improvement is achievable, sometimes 20 days

### 3. CREDIT RISK & DISPUTE MANAGEMENT

**Q: How do you manage credit risk across your AR portfolio?**
A:
- **Risk Categories**:
  - **Low Risk**: Established companies, strong financials, excellent payment history
  - **Medium Risk**: Solid companies, normal payment, some industry headwinds
  - **High Risk**: Startup, weak financials, spotty payment, industry distress
  - **Monitored Risk**: Customer with warning signs, reduced credit limit, required deposits
  
- **Monitoring Process**:
  - Monthly credit review: Analyze customer payment behavior
  - Quarterly financials: Review customer 10-Q/10-K filings (public companies)
  - News monitoring: Check for industry/customer news (layoffs, lawsuits, bankruptcies)
  - Third-party updates: D&B monitoring, alerts for credit deterioration
  
- **Early Warning Signs**:
  - Payment behavior: Increasing lateness, NSF checks
  - Invoices: Disputed invoices, returns, allowance requests
  - Communication: Less responsive, excuses for payment delays
  - Financial news: Missed earnings, analyst downgrades, leadership changes
  - Industry: Downturns affecting customer's business
  
- **Response Actions**:
  - Increase monitoring frequency
  - Reduce credit limit
  - Require deposit on new orders
  - Tighten payment terms (Net 30 vs. Net 60)
  - Escalate to management/executive sponsor
  - Consider exiting relationship if unacceptable risk

**Q: Describe dispute resolution best practices.**
A:
- **Prevention (Best Approach)**:
  - Clear communication: Order confirmation, delivery notification
  - Quality assurance: Right product, right quantity, right condition
  - Billing accuracy: Correct pricing, accurate invoice
  - Documentation: Keep all emails, confirmations, delivery evidence
  
- **Detection**:
  - Customer notification: "We received your dispute on [date] regarding [issue]"
  - Ticket creation: Document in system with customer reference
  - Acknowledgment: "We'll investigate and respond within [# days]"
  
- **Investigation**:
  - Multi-department: Sales, operations, quality, finance
  - Evidence gathering: Emails, delivery proof, quality inspections
  - Root cause: Why did this happen?
  - Timeline: When was issue discovered?
  
- **Resolution Options**:
  - **Accept responsibility**: 100% credit if error on our side
  - **Partial credit**: Split if contributing factors from both sides
  - **Replacement**: Send correct product instead of credit
  - **Investigation ongoing**: If unable to determine, offer payment plan
  
- **Communication**:
  - Professional tone: Acknowledge customer concern
  - Clear resolution: What will happen, when, by whom
  - Escalation: Is customer escalating? Engage account manager
  
- **Follow-up**:
  - Verify customer satisfaction
  - Document root cause, prevent recurrence
  - Update customer relationship status
  - Track dispute metrics (# disputes, avg resolution time, repeat rate)

**Q: How do you prevent dispute-related payment delays?**
A:
- **Payment Strategy**:
  - Split invoice into dispute and non-dispute portions
  - Invoice $1000: $900 undisputed, $100 disputed
  - Demand payment of $900 within terms
  - Resolve $100 dispute separately (may take weeks)
  - Never hold 100% of payment due to partial dispute
  
- **Dispute Tracking**:
  - Flag in AR system: Amount in dispute, not eligible for collection
  - Aging: Disputed amount doesn't age, excluded from DSO calc
  - Collections: Contact customer about non-disputed portion
  
- **Escalation**:
  - If customer refuses to pay undisputed amount, escalate
  - This is different from dispute resolution (payment vs. accuracy)
  - May indicate financial difficulty or payment resistance
  
- **Documentation**:
  - Create clear paper trail: All communications about split
  - Prove customer was notified and agreed (email confirmation)
  - Protect in audit: Shows reasonable dispute management

### 4. BILLING PROCESS & OPTIMIZATION

**Q: Walk me through the complete billing process.**
A:
- **Billing Trigger**:
  - Standard: Goods receipt, invoice created automatically
  - Service: Invoice at milestone, completion, or monthly
  - Subscription: Automatic monthly invoice at start of period
  
- **Invoice Generation**:
  - System creates billing document (SAP VF01, JDE P03B11)
  - Data pulled: Customer master, PO, delivery data, pricing
  - GL coding: Automatic based on sales org, product line
  - Invoice details: Customer name, billing address, PO#, invoice date, terms
  
- **Invoice Accuracy Checks**:
  - Amount verification: Matches PO price × quantity
  - Terms verification: Correct payment terms applied
  - Tax calculation: Correct tax rate for jurisdiction
  - Billing address: Correct customer, not delivery address
  - Invoice numbering: Sequential, no gaps, no duplicates
  
- **Invoice Delivery**:
  - Electronic: Email (preferred, fastest)
  - Portal: Customer downloads from customer portal
  - EDI: Structured electronic delivery for large customers
  - Paper: Mail for customers without email capability
  - Timing: Same day or next business day preferred
  
- **Invoice Posting**:
  - GL posting: DR AR, CR Revenue
  - Subledger: Post to customer account in AR module
  - Validation: Ensure GL balances
  - Revenue recognition: ASC 606/IFRS 15 compliance
  
- **Customer Communication**:
  - Invoice clearly shows: What was shipped/delivered
  - Payment instructions: Where/how to pay, account info
  - Contact info: Who to call with questions
  - Due date: Clearly visible, matches terms
  
- **Exception Handling**:
  - Missing PO: System allows non-PO invoicing (e.g., recurring)
  - Billing holds: Quality issues, disputes → don't invoice yet
  - Partial invoicing: Invoice received portion, hold remainder
  - Adjustments: Credit memos, manual adjustments when needed

**Q: Explain different billing models and how they impact processes.**
A:
- **1. Transaction Billing** (Most Common):
  - Invoice per transaction/shipment
  - Trigger: Goods receipt, invoice created
  - Payment: Invoice due per terms (Net 30, etc.)
  - Systems: SAP VF01, JDE P03B11
  - Suitable for: Goods sales, project-based work
  
- **2. Subscription/Recurring Billing**:
  - Monthly/quarterly/annual invoices
  - Trigger: Calendar date (1st of month, start date)
  - Automation: System generates invoices automatically
  - Deferred revenue: Revenue recognized over contract period
  - Systems: Specialized (Zuora, Billing.com), SAP subscr. mgmt modules
  - Suitable for: SaaS, maintenance contracts, subscriptions
  - Payment: Higher automation, dunning important (failed cards)
  
- **3. Usage-Based Billing** (Consumption):
  - Charged based on usage (e.g., API calls, storage, bandwidth)
  - Trigger: Daily/monthly meter data
  - Meters: Track customer usage throughout period
  - Invoice: Usage aggregated, multiplied by rate
  - Timing: Invoice at end of period
  - Systems: Specialized platforms (Stripe, Zuora)
  - Suitable for: Cloud services, utilities, telecom
  - Challenges: Real-time tracking, meter accuracy, forecasting
  
- **4. Milestone/Progress Billing** (Services):
  - Invoice at specific project milestones
  - Trigger: Completion of phase (design done, development done, testing done)
  - % of billing: Typically split evenly by phase (25%, 25%, 25%, 25%)
  - Revenue recognition: At each milestone (ASC 606)
  - Systems: Project accounting modules (SAP PS, JDE)
  - Suitable for: Professional services, software development, consulting
  - Challenge: Determining when milestone is complete, avoiding disputes
  
- **5. Consolidated/Bulk Billing**:
  - Multiple transactions combined into one invoice
  - Frequency: Weekly/monthly consolidation
  - Benefit: Reduces # of invoices, easier payment (one check)
  - Customer preference: Likely requested
  - Timing: Send consolidated by specific date each period
  - Suitable for: Customers with high transaction volume
  
- **6. Advance Billing** (Retainers/Prepayment):
  - Invoice before service delivery
  - Examples: Retainer fees, annual software licenses, prepaid services
  - Payment: Expected before service begins
  - Revenue recognition: Deferred until service delivered (ASC 606)
  - GL: Deferred revenue liability initially
  - Suitable for: Professional services, high-risk customers, software licenses
  
- **Process Considerations**:
  - Billing frequency impacts DSO (more frequent = faster cash)
  - Automation opportunities (recurring highest ROI)
  - Customer preferences (some want consolidated, some want detail)
  - System capabilities (not all systems support all models)

**Q: How would you reduce billing cycle time from 5 days to 1 day?**
A:
- **Current State (5-day cycle)**:
  - Day 1-2: Goods receipt processing, system entry by warehouse
  - Day 3: Invoice creation (manual batch process)
  - Day 4: Invoice accuracy review by finance
  - Day 5: Invoice delivery (batch email or portal)
  
- **Quick Wins**:
  - **Automation (Day 1)**: Auto-create invoice upon goods receipt
    - Eliminate manual trigger for invoice generation
    - SAP: Configure billing in delivery document
    - Result: Shorten to 2-3 days
  
  - **Real-time validation (Day 2)**: Quality assurance built in
    - Validate during receipt, not in separate step
    - Prevent downstream corrections
  
  - **Streamlined approval (Day 3)**: Exception-only review
    - Only review exceptions (large amount, new customer, missing data)
    - 95%+ pass through automatically
    - Result: Shorten cycle
  
  - **Immediate delivery (Day 3-4)**: Email invoice same day
    - Don't wait for batch, send individually
    - Faster notification to customer
  
- **Medium-term**:
  - **System upgrade to S/4HANA**: Real-time billing
  - **Process re-engineering**: Invoice at shipment, not receipt
  - **Exception handling**: Design workflow for edge cases
  
- **Target State (1-day)**:
  - Customer receives invoice same day as shipment
  - Possible because: No manual steps, automated validation
  - Process: Receipt → Auto-validate → Auto-invoice → Email delivery
  - Works when: Process is stable, few exceptions
  
- **Challenges**:
  - **Accuracy**: Manual review catches errors, automation may miss
  - **Exceptions**: Real-time invoicing may invoice wrong amount
  - **Customer readiness**: Do customers expect 1-day billing?
  - **Risk**: Higher error rate if not designed carefully

**Q: Explain revenue recognition impact on billing.**
A:
- **ASC 606 Five-Step Model**:
  1. Identify contract with customer
  2. Identify performance obligations (what will you deliver?)
  3. Determine transaction price (what's the price?)
  4. Allocate price to performance obligations
  5. Recognize revenue when (or as) you satisfy the obligation
  
- **Billing vs. Revenue Recognition**:
  - **Billing**: When you invoice the customer
  - **Revenue Recognition**: When you record the revenue in P&L
  - These are often DIFFERENT!
  
- **Examples**:
  - **Upfront invoicing, over-time recognition**:
    - Annual software license invoiced upfront
    - Invoice immediately (cash received)
    - Recognize monthly over 12 months
    - GL: Deferred revenue liability until recognized
  
  - **Delivery upon receipt recognition**:
    - Standard goods sale
    - Bill upon delivery
    - Revenue recognized at delivery (performance obligation)
    - GL: Revenue recognized same day
  
  - **Milestone-based service**:
    - 4-phase project, customer pre-pays full amount
    - Bill upon contract signing
    - Recognize 25% at each milestone completion
    - GL: Staggered revenue over project timeline
  
- **Accounting Entries**:
  - Invoice: DR AR, CR Deferred Revenue (if not recognized yet)
  - Recognition: DR Deferred Revenue, CR Revenue
  - Overall: AR increases, Revenue increases, but timing differs
  
- **System Implications**:
  - Billing system: Creates invoice, posts to AR
  - Revenue system: Separate accounting for deferred recognition
  - Reconciliation: Monthly matching of invoice to revenue
  - Audit: Key audit focus (intentional misstatement risk)

### 5. CREDIT & COLLECTIONS METRICS

**Q: What are the key credit metrics to monitor?**
A:
- **DSO (Days Sales Outstanding)**: (AR ÷ Daily Revenue) = days
  - Target: 30-40 days (varies by industry)
  - Benchmark: Compare to prior year, industry
  - Driver: Invoicing speed, collection effectiveness
  
- **AR Aging**:
  - Current: Not yet past due
  - 1-30 days: Minor issue
  - 31-60 days: Moderate issue, needs collection
  - 61-90 days: Significant risk
  - 90+ days: Collectability in question
  - % of AR in each bucket indicates collection health
  
- **Collections Metrics**:
  - Collection rate: % of overdue AR collected within 30 days
  - Target: 80-90%
  - Calculation: Collected / Total overdue 30 days ago = %
  
- **Bad Debt Write-off Rate**:
  - % of annual revenue written off
  - Industry average: 0.5-2% for B2B, up to 5% for consumer
  - Trend: Should be stable or declining
  - High rate indicates underwriting or collection problems
  
- **Allowance for Doubtful Accounts**:
  - % of AR set aside for expected losses
  - Industry: 1-3% typical
  - Calculation: Historical loss % applied to AR
  - Audit: Key focus area
  
- **Collection Efficiency Index (CEI)**:
  - (Current month revenue ÷ (Current month + Prior month AR))
  - Measures: Speed of converting invoices to cash
  - Target: >1.0 (collecting faster than invoicing)
  
- **First-Pass Collection Rate**:
  - % of invoices collected on first demand (no follow-up)
  - Target: 50-70%
  - Indicates: Quality of customer, accuracy of invoicing

### 6. SPECIAL SCENARIOS & SITUATIONS

**Q: How do you handle customer bankruptcy or insolvency?**
A:
- **Bankruptcy Types**:
  - Chapter 7: Liquidation (company dissolves, assets sold)
  - Chapter 11: Reorganization (company restructures, continues)
  - Chapter 13: Personal bankruptcy
  
- **Creditor Steps**:
  1. **Notice**: Receive notice of bankruptcy filing
  2. **Claim filing**: Submit proof of claim to bankruptcy court (strict deadline - typically 70 days)
  3. **Recovery evaluation**: Estimate recovery % (depends on asset liquidation, priority)
  4. **Creditor meeting**: May attend meeting (usually 1-3 months after filing)
  5. **Negotiation**: In reorganization, may negotiate plan (get 50 cents on dollar vs. nothing)
  6. **Distribution**: Receive payment per plan (if any)
  
- **Accounting Treatment**:
  - Immediately: Write down receivable to estimated recovery value
  - Example: $100K claim, estimated 20% recovery → Write off $80K
  - Conservative: Better to over-provide than under-provide
  - Ongoing: Update as situation develops
  
- **Prevention**:
  - Monitor for bankruptcy signals (news, financial deterioration, credit rating downgrade)
  - Tighter credit terms for companies in distress
  - Get secured position (lien on assets) if possible
  - Reduce credit limit, require deposits

**Q: Describe how to handle multi-currency billing and collections.**
A:
- **Invoicing**:
  - Currency choice: Your currency or customer's currency?
  - Standard: Large multinational customers expect native currency
  - Small customers: Often invoiced in your currency
  - Configuration: Set up in customer master data
  
- **Exchange Rate**:
  - Transaction rate: Rate on invoice date (locked for invoicing)
  - Payment rate: Rate on payment date (may differ)
  - GL: Difference creates realized gain/loss
  - Systems: SAP, JDE have daily exchange rate tables
  
- **Gain/Loss**:
  - Example: Invoice $100K in EUR when rate is 1.10 (= €110,000)
  - Customer pays 2 weeks later at rate 1.08
