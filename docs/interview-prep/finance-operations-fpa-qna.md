A:
- **Definition**: Financial Planning & Analysis is the business partner function that supports strategic decision-making through financial analysis, forecasting, and planning.
  
- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - **Annual Budget**: Develop annual financial plan
  - **Forecasting**: Update forecast monthly/quarterly based on actuals
  - **Analysis**: Variance analysis, explain budget vs. actual vs. forecast
  - **Scenario Planning**: What-if analysis, stress testing
  - **Business Cases**: Support major initiatives with financial analysis
  - **Reporting**: Executive scorecards, financial dashboards
  - **Strategy Support**: Analyze options, recommend optimal path
  
- **Stakeholders**:
  - CFO: Reports to finance leadership
  - Business units: Provide guidance, challenge assumptions
  - Finance: Oversee accounting, controls
  - Board/Executive: Receive reports, approve strategy
  
- **Impact**:
  - Drives strategic decisions (enter new market, exit market, acquisitions)
  - Optimizes operations (pricing, headcount, capex)
  - Manages cash flow, financial performance
  - Identifies risks and opportunities

**Q: What's the difference between budgeting, forecasting, and planning?**
A:
- **Budgeting**:
  - Frequency: Annual (sometimes updated quarterly)
  - Nature: What we plan to achieve
  - Rigidity: Fixed for the year (or period)
  - Process: Bottom-up (departments) + top-down (management targets)
  - Use: Control, accountability, assess performance against plan
  - Example: "This year we plan to generate $100M revenue"
  
- **Forecasting**:
  - Frequency: Monthly or quarterly updates
  - Nature: What we expect to actually achieve
  - Rigidity: Flexible, updated frequently
  - Process: Based on actuals to date, trends, pipeline
  - Use: Realistic view of expected outcome, decision-making
  - Example: "Based on Q1 actuals and Q2 trends, we'll likely generate $95M revenue"
  
- **Rolling Forecasts**:
  - Hybrid approach combining forecast + planning
  - Always maintain 12-month rolling view (e.g., Feb 2026 = May 2025-Apr 2026)
  - More agile than traditional annual budget
  - Gaining popularity in fast-moving industries
  
- **Planning**:
  - Long-term strategic financial vision (3-5 years)
  - Aligned with business strategy
  - Identifies investments needed, profitability targets
  - Less detail than budget (higher level)

### 2. BUDGETING PROCESS & APPROACH

**Q: Walk me through the annual budgeting process.**
A:
- **Phase 1: Kick-off (3-4 months before fiscal year)**:
  - Finance provides guidelines: Revenue targets, expense assumptions, discount rate
  - Board expectations: Profit target, growth targets, cash requirements
  - Market outlook: Macroeconomic assumptions, industry trends
  
- **Phase 2: Bottom-up Development (2-3 months)**:
  - Business units develop detailed budgets:
    - Sales: By customer, product, region (build-up from pipeline)
    - Operations: Costs by department, activity-based if possible
    - G&A: Corporate costs allocated
  - Finance reviews: Reasonableness checks, consistency with guidance
  - Iterations: Feedback loop, multiple rounds of refinement
  
- **Phase 3: Consolidation (1 month)**:
  - Finance consolidates: All business units into company-wide budget
  - Validation: Reconciliation with guidelines, variance analysis
  - Gap analysis: How far from corporate targets?
  - Management review: Present to senior leaders, identify gaps
  
- **Phase 4: Refinement (2-3 weeks)**:
  - Finance works with business: Address gaps, identify opportunities
  - Negotiation: Achieve financial targets while supporting business
  - Scenario analysis: Show impact of different strategies
  
- **Phase 5: Approval (1 week)**:
  - CFO approval: Meets financial targets, reasonable assumptions
  - Board approval: Strategic review, dividend/capex approval
  - Communication: Share approved budget with organization
  
- **Timeline Example**:
  - Jan: Kick-off
  - Feb-March: Business units develop, submit budgets
  - April: Finance consolidates, identifies gaps
  - May: Refinement, scenario analysis
  - June: Final approval
  - July 1: New fiscal year begins

**Q: Describe the budgeting approach for different types of organizations.**
A:
- **Product Company** (Manufacturing):
  - Revenue budget: By product line, customer, region
  - Drivers: Unit sales volume, average price per unit
  - COGS: % of revenue, scaled with volume
  - Operating expenses: Sales commissions (% of revenue), R&D (fixed), Marketing
  - Capital budget: Equipment for manufacturing
  
- **Service Company** (Consulting):
  - Revenue budget: By consultant, billable utilization rate
  - Drivers: # consultants, utilization % (target 70-80%), bill rate
  - Expenses: Salaries (largest cost), travel, infrastructure
  - Headcount budget: Critical driver (one consultant = ~$100K-$200K)
  - Project-based: Budget by project/engagement
  
- **SaaS/Subscription**:
  - Revenue budget: By product, customer segment
  - Drivers: New customers acquired, churn rate, ARPU (average revenue per user)
  - Recurring model: Revenue fairly predictable
  - Expenses: R&D (high %), Customer support, Marketing, Sales
  - Focus: Customer acquisition cost (CAC) vs. lifetime value (LTV)
  
- **Enterprise (Diverse)**:
  - Multiple business units: Each with different models
  - Headcount budget: Largest component, detailed by level, function
  - Capex budget: Significant capital investments, strategic initiatives
  - Shared services: Finance, HR, IT allocated to business units
  - Consolidation: Complex multi-level consolidation process

**Q: What approaches do you use to budget uncertain or cyclical expenses?**
A:
- **Fixed vs. Variable**:
  - **Fixed**: Rent, salaries, insurance → Budget as fixed amount
  - **Variable**: Sales commissions, COGS → Budget as % of revenue
  - Mixed: Some activities have both components
  
- **Seasonal/Cyclical**:
  - Identify pattern: Q4 highest sales, Q1 lowest (e.g., retail)
  - Budget quarterly: Show seasonal variation, not level monthly
  - Prior-year comparison: Analyze historical Q4 vs. Q1 patterns
  - Adjust for growth: Layered approach (baseline + growth)
  
- **Discretionary Spending**:
  - Marketing: Could be $1M-$5M depending on strategy
  - Approach: Budget by initiative, not percentage of revenue
  - Trade-off analysis: Show ROI of different spending levels
  
- **One-time/Irregular**:
  - IT system implementation, office relocation, severance
  - Budget as separate line items, labeled as one-time
  - Exclude from operational performance analysis
  
- **External Dependencies**:
  - Commodity prices: Use consensus forecast, hedge exposure
  - Interest rates: Budget based on debt level, current rates
  - Foreign exchange: Budget at mid-range rates, monitor actuals
  - Energy: Forecast based on usage and market prices

### 3. FORECASTING & VARIANCE ANALYSIS

**Q: Explain the difference between forecast accuracy and budget variance.**
A:
- **Budget Variance**:
  - Definition: Actual vs. Budget
  - Timing: Monthly reconciliation
  - Purpose: Assess how well we planned
  - Example: Budgeted $1M revenue, actual $950K → $50K unfavorable variance
  - Issue: Budget was set months ago, may be obsolete
  
- **Forecast Variance**:
  - Definition: Actual vs. Current Forecast
  - Timing: Monthly reconciliation
  - Purpose: Assess accuracy of latest plan
  - Example: Forecasted $950K, actual $950K → $0 variance, forecast is accurate
  - Value: Shows whether current plan is realistic
  
- **Forecast Accuracy (Hit Rate)**:
  - Definition: How often forecast equals actual (within +/-5%)
  - Measurement: % of months actual within forecast range
  - Target: >80% forecast accuracy
  - Improvement: Better data, refined assumptions
  
- **Strategic Use**:
  - If budget variance is bad: Indicates prior planning was poor
  - If forecast variance is bad: Indicates current execution differs from plan
  - Forecast accuracy is better metric: Shows management's realism
  - Best practice: Focus on forecast, not budget variance

**Q: How do you perform monthly variance analysis?**
A:
- **Typical Variance Report**:
  - Current month: Budget, Actual, Variance, % Variance
  - Year-to-date: Budget, Actual, Variance, % Variance
  - Forecast: For remainder of year
  - Explanations: For variances >10% or >$100K
  
- **Revenue Variance Analysis**:
  - Breakdown:
    - Volume variance: Sold fewer/more units than planned
    - Price variance: Average selling price higher/lower than planned
    - Mix variance: Different product mix than expected
  - Example:
    - Budget: 100 units × $100 = $10K
    - Actual: 90 units × $110 = $9.9K
    - Volume: 10 fewer units × $100 = -$1K unfavorable
    - Price: 90 units × $10 higher = +$900 favorable
    - Total: -$100 unfavorable (but driven by different factors)
  
- **Expense Variance Analysis**:
  - Headcount: # of people budgeted vs. actual, salary variance
  - Discretionary: Travel, marketing, etc. - controllable items
  - Fixed: Rent, insurance - usually on budget
  - Variable: Scaled with revenue, should track with actuals
  
- **Explanation Framework** (Provided for >10% variance):
  - What: Description of variance
  - Why: Root cause
  - Impact: Magnitude, is it permanent or temporary?
  - Action: What is being done to address? Expected timeline?
  - Outlook: Impact on rest of year (forecasted resolution)

**Q: Describe how to build a monthly rolling forecast.**
A:
- **Rolling 12-Month Forecast**:
  - Current month + next 11 months always planned
  - Each month, update with actuals, drop oldest month
  - Benefit: Always forward-looking, not static annual budget
  - More agile: Respond to changing conditions
  
- **Process**:
  - Month 1 (Jan): Develop detailed forecast Jan-Dec
  - Month 2 (Feb): Update with Jan actuals, reforecast Feb-Dec and add Jan next year
  - Month 3 (Mar): Update with Feb actuals, reforecast Mar-next Mar
  - And so on...
  
- **Different Detail Levels**:
  - **Near-term** (Next 3 months): Detailed, by department/product
  - **Mid-term** (Months 4-8): Moderate detail, by major category
  - **Far-term** (Months 9-12): Summary level, less detailed
  - Rationale: Greater uncertainty further out, don't over-detail
  
- **Assumptions Update**:
  - Review drivers monthly: Revenue growth %, COGS %, headcount
  - Update if conditions change: Pipeline strength, market conditions, staffing plans
  - Document assumptions: Allow trace back to drivers
  - Sensitivity analysis: What if X changes by 10%?
  
- **Communication**:
  - Compare to prior month's forecast: Explain changes
  - Full-year outlook: Total year revenue, profit
  - Quarterly view: Trend through rest of year
  - Risk assessment: Downside/upside scenarios

### 4. SCENARIO ANALYSIS & WHAT-IF MODELING

**Q: Explain scenario analysis and when to use it.**
A:
- **Definition**: Building multiple versions of the future based on different assumptions
  
- **Common Scenarios**:
  - **Base Case**: Most likely outcome (50% probability)
  - **Upside Case**: Optimistic (30% probability), higher growth, lower costs
  - **Downside Case**: Pessimistic (20% probability), lower growth, higher costs
  
- **Use Cases**:
  - **Strategic initiatives**: New product launch - show different market penetration scenarios
  - **Macroeconomic uncertainty**: Recession risk - show different growth scenarios
  - **Acquisition analysis**: Show standalone vs. with acquisition
  - **Pricing decisions**: Show profitability at different price points
  - **Capex decisions**: Show payback period under different utilization scenarios
  
- **Building Scenarios** (Example: SaaS company):
  - **Revenue Drivers**:
    - New customers: 100 (base), 150 (upside), 50 (downside)
    - Churn rate: 5% (base), 3% (upside), 8% (downside)
    - ARPU: $5K (base), $6K (upside), $4K (downside)
  - **Result**:
    - Base: 100 new + (1000 existing × 95%) × $5K = $5.45M
    - Upside: 150 new + (1000 × 97%) × $6K = $6.57M
    - Downside: 50 new + (1000 × 92%) × $4K = $3.88M
  
- **Decision-Making**:
  - Base case: Plan organizational structure/expenses for this case
  - Upside/Downside: Identify flex opportunities
  - Breakeven: At what revenue do we need action?
  - Risk mitigation: What can we control? Where are dependencies?

**Q: How do you build a financial model for a business case?**
A:
- **Framework** (5-year projection typical):
  
  1. **Assumptions Section**:
     - Revenue drivers: Units, price, growth rates
     - Cost drivers: % of revenue, inflation rates, headcount plans
     - Financing: Debt, equity, interest rates
     - Discount rate: For NPV calculation (typically WACC, 8-10%)
  
  2. **Income Statement Projection**:
     - Year 1-5 monthly/quarterly then annual
     - Revenue (using drivers)
     - COGS (typically % of revenue)
     - Operating expenses (by category)
     - EBITDA, Interest, Taxes
     - Net income
  
  3. **Cash Flow Projection**:
     - Operating CF: Net income + depreciation - working capital changes
     - Capex: Capital expenditures needed
     - Financing: Debt, equity proceeds/repayment
     - Free cash flow: Available for investors
  
  4. **Balance Sheet Projection** (if needed):
     - Assets: Equipment, receivables, inventory
     - Liabilities: Debt, payables
     - Equity: Ending equity balance
  
  5. **Metrics Calculation**:
     - NPV: Present value of future cash flows (discount rate dependent)
     - IRR: Internal rate of return (discount rate at which NPV=0)
     - Payback: Years to recover initial investment
     - ROI: Profit ÷ Investment
  
  6. **Sensitivity Analysis**:
     - Key assumptions: Revenue growth rate, COGS %, discount rate
     - Test: How does NPV/IRR change if assumption changes by ±10%, ±20%?
     - Identify: Which assumptions have greatest impact on outcome?
     - Recommendation: Mitigate high-risk assumptions
  
- **Example: SaaS Product Launch**:
  - Investment: $500K engineering + $200K marketing = $700K upfront
  - Revenue: Year 1 = $100K, Year 2 = $500K, Year 3 = $1.5M, Year 4 = $2M, Year 5 = $2.5M
  - Gross margin: 75% (typical for SaaS)
  - Operating expenses: Scale with revenue, 50% of revenue by year 3
  - Discount rate: 10%
  - Calculation: Sum PV of cash flows → NPV = $2.1M (positive, greenlight)
  - Sensitivity: If Year 3 revenue drops 20%, NPV still $1.2M (robust decision)

### 5. FINANCIAL STATEMENT ANALYSIS & METRICS

**Q: Explain the three financial statements and their relationships.**
A:
- **Income Statement** (P&L):
  - Shows: Revenue - Expenses = Net Income
  - Period: Specific time period (month, quarter, year)
  - Use: Assess profitability
  - Example:
    - Revenue: $10M
    - COGS: -$4M
    - Gross profit: $6M (60% margin)
    - Operating expenses: -$4M
    - Operating income: $2M (20% margin)
    - Taxes: -$500K
    - Net income: $1.5M (15% net margin)
  
- **Balance Sheet** (Statement of Financial Position):
  - Shows: Assets = Liabilities + Equity
  - Point in time: Usually end of period
  - Use: Assess financial position, liquidity, solvency
  - Assets:
    - Current: Cash, accounts receivable, inventory (convert to cash within 1 year)
    - Non-current: Equipment, real estate, intangibles
  - Liabilities:
    - Current: Accounts payable, short-term debt, accrued expenses
    - Long-term: Long-term debt, deferred revenue
  - Equity: Paid-in capital + retained earnings (accumulated profits)
  
- **Cash Flow Statement**:
  - Shows: Where cash came from and where it went
  - Period: Specific period
  - Three sections:
    - **Operating**: Cash from running business (net income + adjustments)
    - **Investing**: Cash used for capex, acquisitions (outflow)
    - **Financing**: Cash from debt/equity, payments (inflow/outflow)
  - Start: Beginning cash balance
  - End: Ending cash balance (ties to balance sheet)

- **How They Connect**:
  - P&L net income flows to balance sheet (retained earnings)
  - Cash from P&L (adjusted for non-cash items) = Operating cash flow
  - Cash flow statement shows cash impact of P&L and balance sheet changes

**Q: What are key financial ratios and what do they indicate?**
A:
- **Profitability Ratios**:
  - Gross margin: (Gross profit ÷ Revenue) = % - Indicates pricing power, cost control
  - Operating margin: (Operating income ÷ Revenue) = % - Indicates operational efficiency
  - Net margin: (Net income ÷ Revenue) = % - Overall profitability
  - Return on assets (ROA): (Net income ÷ Total assets) = % - Asset efficiency
  - Return on equity (ROE): (Net income ÷ Equity) = % - Shareholder return
  
- **Liquidity Ratios** (Can we pay short-term obligations?):
  - Current ratio: (Current assets ÷ Current liabilities) = X
    - >1.5 is healthy, <1.0 means liquidity risk
  - Quick ratio: (Current assets - Inventory) ÷ Current liabilities
    - More conservative, excludes inventory
  - Cash ratio: (Cash ÷ Current liabilities)
    - Most conservative, only cash
  
- **Leverage Ratios** (How much debt?):
  - Debt-to-equity: (Total debt ÷ Total equity) = X
    - Industry dependent, 1.0 is neutral
  - Debt-to-assets: (Total debt ÷ Total assets) = %
    - Shows % financed by debt
  - Interest coverage: (EBITDA ÷ Interest expense) = X
    - How many times can we cover interest? >3.0 is safe
  
- **Efficiency Ratios**:
  - Asset turnover: (Revenue ÷ Total assets) = X
    - How many $ revenue per $ of assets?
  - Inventory turnover: (COGS ÷ Inventory) = X
    - How many times is inventory sold/replaced?
  - Receivables turnover: (Revenue ÷ AR) = X
    - Related to DSO (DSO = 365 ÷ Receivables turnover)
  
- **Growth Ratios**:
  - Revenue growth: (Current revenue - Prior year) ÷ Prior year = %
  - Earnings growth: Similar calculation for net income
  - Compare to: Prior year, budget, industry, market growth

**Q: Explain the concept of working capital and how to optimize it.**
A:
- **Definition**:
  - Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities
  - Measures: Short-term financial health, cash availability
  - Example: $100M current assets - $60M current liabilities = $40M WC
  
- **Components**:
  - **Cash**: Liquidity buffer, investment
  - **Receivables (AR)**: Cash tied up in unpaid invoices
  - **Inventory**: Cash tied up in inventory
  - **Payables (AP)**: Free cash from vendors (not yet paid)
  
- **Cash Conversion Cycle** (CCC):
  - CCC = DIO + DSO - DPO
  - **DIO** (Days Inventory Outstanding): How long inventory sits
  - **DSO** (Days Sales Outstanding): How long to collect cash
  - **DPO** (Days Payable Outstanding): How long before we pay vendors
  - Example: 40 DIO + 30 DSO - 45 DPO = 25 days CCC
    - Means: 25 days of cash tied up in operations (negative is even better!)
  
- **Optimization Strategies**:
  - **Reduce Inventory** (Lower DIO):
    - Just-in-time inventory: Order only what's needed
    - Demand forecasting: Better demand planning reduces safety stock
    - Product design: Standardize components, reduce SKU count
    - Supplier management: More frequent smaller orders
  
  - **Accelerate Collections** (Lower DSO):
    - Early invoicing: Invoice at shipment, not delivery
    - Early payment discounts: 2% discount to pay in 10 days
    - Automated billing and dunning
    - Payment options: Make paying easy
  
  - **Extend Payables** (Increase DPO):
    - Negotiate longer terms: 30 vs. 60 days
    - Use supply chain financing: Extend terms through financing provider
    - Strategic timing: Pay on last day, not first day
  
  - **Overall Impact**:
    - Reduce CCC by 10 days = Free up significant cash
    - Example: $500M revenue = $41M daily revenue
    - 10-day improvement = $4.1M cash freed up

### 6. CAPITAL ALLOCATION & CAPEX PLANNING

**Q: Explain the capex planning process.**
A:
- **Types of Capex**:
  - **Maintenance**: Replace aging equipment (necessary, low risk)
  - **Expansion**: New equipment to grow capacity (higher risk, strategic)
  - **Innovation**: New capabilities, technology (highest risk, strategic)
  
- **Capex Process**:
  1. **Business case development**: Detailed financial analysis
     - Investment amount
     - Revenue impact or cost savings
     - ROI, IRR, payback period
     - Strategic alignment
  2. **Prioritization**: Rank by ROI, strategic priority, risk
  3. **Capital budget setting**: Total capex allocation
  4. **Approval process**: Different levels by amount
     - <$100K: Department manager
     - $100K-$500K: CFO
     - >$500K: Board
  5. **Execution**: Project management, tracking
  6. **Benefits realization**: Track actual results vs. plan
  
- **Evaluation Criteria**:
  - **NPV**: Positive NPV = creates shareholder value
  - **IRR**: Higher IRR = better return
  - **Payback**: How long to recover investment? (shorter is better)
  - **Strategic alignment**: Fits long-term strategy?
  - **Risk**: How certain are outcomes?
  
- **Example: Equipment Purchase**:
  - Investment: $1M
  - Annual savings: $300K/year for 5 years
  - Salvage value: $100K
  - Discount rate: 10%
  - NPV = PV($300K × 5 years) + PV($100K) - $1M = $137K (positive, approve)
  - IRR = 15% (above 10% hurdle rate, approve)
  - Payback = $1M ÷ $300K = 3.3 years (reasonable for equipment)

**Q: How do you allocate capital across competing priorities?**
A:
- **Scarce Resource**:
  - Limited total capex budget (e.g., $5M)
  - More opportunities than budget ($10M worth)
  - Must prioritize
  
- **Framework**:
  1. **Tier 1: Mandatory**
     - Maintenance capex (necessary to keep running)
     - Safety/compliance projects (legal requirement)
     - No ROI, but critical
     - Typical: 40-50% of budget
  
  2. **Tier 2: High Return**
     - High ROI projects (>20% IRR)
     - Payback <2 years
     - Relatively certain outcomes
     - Typical: 30-40% of budget
  
  3. **Tier 3: Strategic**
     - Strategic initiatives (new market, new product)
     - Lower guaranteed ROI but strategic importance
     - Aligned with long-term plan
     - Typical: 10-20% of budget
  
  4. **Tier 4: Nice-to-have**
     - Efficiency improvements with <15% ROI
     - Payback >3 years
     - Deferred if budget constrained
  
- **Decision Matrix**:
  - Rank by: (ROI × Strategic weight) ÷ Risk score
  - Example:
    - Project A: 25% IRR × 1.0 (high strategic weight) ÷ 0.8 (low risk) = 31 points (high priority)
    - Project B: 15% IRR × 1.5 (higher strategic weight) ÷ 1.5 (higher risk) = 15 points (lower priority)

### 7. PROFITABILITY ANALYSIS & OPTIMIZATION

**Q: How do you perform profitability analysis by product, customer, or segment?**
A:
- **Challenges**:
  - Revenues clear: Directly attributable to product/customer/segment
  - Costs complex: Direct (COGS) vs. indirect (allocated overhead)
  - Allocation: How to fairly allocate shared costs?
  
- **Profitability Hierarchy**:
  - **Gross profit**: Revenue - COGS (directly traceable)
  - **Contribution margin**: Revenue - Variable costs (COGS + commissions)
  - **Segment profit**: Revenue - Segment-specific costs
  - **Fully absorbed profit**: Revenue - All costs (including allocation)
  
- **Analysis by Product**:
  - Segment revenue: Identify by product line
  - COGS: Direct material, labor, manufacturing overhead
  - Gross margin: Revenue - COGS
  - Variable expenses: Sales commissions, packaging
  - Contribution margin: Gross margin - Variable expenses
  - Segment costs: R&D, product management (allocated to product)
  - Segment profit: Contribution - Segment costs
  - Example:
    - Product A revenue: $10M
    - COGS: $4M → Gross profit: $6M (60%)
    - Commissions: $1M → Contribution: $5M (50%)
    - Product costs: $2M → Segment profit: $3M (30%)
  
- **Analysis by Customer**:
  - Revenue: What did customer purchase?
  - COGS: Product cost
  - Gross margin: Revenue - COGS
  - Sales cost: Sales rep time, travel (allocated)
  - Service cost: Support, returns (allocated or direct)
  - Customer profit: Gross margin - Sales cost - Service cost
  - Action: Profitable customers get service, unprofitable might be exited
  
- **ABC Analysis** (Activity-Based Costing):
  - Traditional allocation: All overhead ÷ Revenue (or units)
  - ABC: Track activities, allocate overhead by activity consumption
  - Example:
    - Traditional: All overhead = 30% of revenue
    - ABC: Order processing = $X per order, delivery = $Y per shipment
      - Customer A: Few large orders → Lower overhead cost
      - Customer B: Many small orders → Higher overhead cost
  
- **Actions Based on Analysis**:
  - High-margin products: Invest, promote, expand
  - Low-margin products: Reposition (raise price, reduce cost) or exit
  - Profitable customers: Maintain, grow, increase wallet share
  - Unprofitable customers: Rationalize (increase price, reduce service) or exit

**Q: What are common levers to improve profitability?**
A:
- **Revenue Side**:
  - **Price Increase**: 1% price increase often = 5-10% profit increase (if cost doesn't change)
  - **Mix**: Shift sales to higher-margin products
  - **Volume**: Operate at higher utilization, spread fixed costs
  - **Customer quality**: Shift to higher-margin customer segments
  
- **Cost Side**:
  - **COGS Reduction**:
    - Negotiate with suppliers: Volume discounts, long-term contracts
    - Operational efficiency: Reduce waste, improve yields
    - Automation: Replace labor with technology
    - Sourcing: Move production to lower-cost locations
  - **Operating Expense Reduction**:
    - Headcount optimization: Reduce via attrition, reorg
    - Process efficiency: Automation, standardization
    - Overhead reduction: Consolidate locations, shared services
    - Discretionary: Cut marketing, travel, consultants (short-term)
  
- **Capital Efficiency**:
  - Reduce working capital: Lower inventory, accelerate AR collections
  - Asset optimization: Better asset utilization, avoid underutilized assets
  - Capex efficiency: Higher-return capex, avoid low-return projects
  
- **Example - Margin Expansion**:
  - Current: Revenue $100M, COGS $60M, OpEx $30M → Profit $10M (10%)
  - Option 1 - Price increase 3%: Revenue $103M, COGS $60M, OpEx $30M → Profit $13M (13%)
  - Option 2 - COGS reduction 3%: Revenue $100M, COGS $58.2M, OpEx $30M → Profit $11.8M (11.8%)
  - Option 3 - OpEx reduction 3%: Revenue $100M, COGS $60M, OpEx $29.1M → Profit $10.9M (10.9%)
  - **Price increase** has biggest impact

### 8. CASH FLOW MANAGEMENT & FORECASTING

**Q: Explain the importance of cash flow vs. profit.**
A:
- **Key Difference**:
  - **Profit**: Revenue - Expenses = P&L
  - **Cash**: Money actually coming in and going out
  - Not the same!
  
- **Example**:
  - Sell $1M product on 90-day terms:
    - Revenue recognized: $1M (profit increases)
    - Cash received: $0 today, $1M in 90 days
  - Pro forma profit: $300K ($1M × 30% margin)
  - Cash flow impact: -$600K (if inventory cost $600K)
  - Result: Profitable deal that hurts cash!
  
- **Why Cash Matters**:
  - Profit is accounting, cash is real
  - Payroll, suppliers, debt payments need cash
  - Run out of cash = bankruptcy (even if profitable)
  - Cash drives valuation: "Cash is king"
  
- **Common Profit ≠ Cash Situations**:
  - Growth: Revenue grows but cash used for working capital
  - Seasonality: Q4 profitable but slow to collect → Q1 cash crisis
  - Customer concentration: Major customer payment delay hurts cash
  - Capex: Significant capex = cash outflow not in P&L

**Q: How do you forecast cash flow?**
A:
- **Components**:
  - **Operating activities**: Cash from P&L
  - **Investing activities**: Capex, acquisitions
  - **Financing activities**: Debt, equity, dividends
  
- **Operating Cash Flow Forecast**:
  - Start: Net income (from P&L forecast)
  - Add back: Depreciation, amortization (non-cash charges)
  - Adjust for working capital changes:
    - Increase in AR: Cash outflow (customers owe more)
    - Decrease in AR: Cash inflow (customers paid down)
    - Increase in inventory: Cash outflow (tied up in inventory)
    - Decrease in inventory: Cash inflow (sold inventory)
    - Increase in AP: Cash inflow (we owe vendors more)
    - Decrease in AP: Cash outflow (we pay vendors)
  
- **Example**:
  - Net income: $1M
  - Depreciation: $200K (add back)
  - AR increase: $300K (subtract, cash outflow)
  - Inventory decrease: $100K (add, cash inflow)
  - AP increase: $150K (add, cash inflow)
  - Operating cash flow: $1.15M
  
- **Cash Balance Projection**:
  - Beginning cash: Month 0 cash balance
  - Operating CF: +$1.15M
  - Capex: -$500K
  - Debt payments: -$200K
  - Ending cash: Beginning + CF - Capex - Debt
  
- **Monitoring**:
  - Weekly cash flow: For 13-week rolling forecast (near-term focus)
  - Monthly: For full-year forecast
  - Liquidity: Ensure minimum cash balance maintained

  - **Size**: Total addressable market (TAM), growth rate
  - **Competition**: # competitors, market leaders, competitive positioning
  - **Barriers to entry**: Capital required, regulatory, customer switching cost
  - **Customer needs**: What do they want? Do we meet needs?
  - **Pricing**: What can customers pay? Margin potential?
  
- **Financial Analysis**:
  - **Investment needed**: Sales/marketing to acquire customers, capex, staffing
  - **Time to profitability**: When does market become profitable?
  - **Margin potential**: Gross margin %, operating margin %
  - **ROI**: 5-year projection, NPV, IRR
  - **Breakeven**: Units or revenue needed to break even
  
- **Strategic Fit**:
  - **Alignment**: Does market align with corporate strategy?
  - **Synergies**: Can we leverage existing capabilities? Share resources?
  - **Risk**: What could go wrong? Competitive response?
  - **Execution**: Can we execute? Do we have talent, capabilities?
  
- **Decision Framework**:
  - Go: Large TAM, high margin, good fit, reasonable investment
  - Maybe: Good market but high investment or execution risk
  - No-go: Small market, low margins, poor fit, or too risky
  
- **Real Example**:
  - Analyzing SaaS market entry:
    - TAM: $50B, growing 20% annually → Attractive
    - Competitors: Saturated → But niche opportunities exist
    - Positioning: Specific vertical (e.g., healthcare) → Defensible
    - Investment: $10M over 3 years → Reasonable for SaaS
    - Margin: SaaS typically 60-80% gross → Attractive
    - ROI: 5-year NPV $50M → Greenlight if strategic fit

**Q: How would you approach a merger or acquisition financial analysis?**
A:
- **Valuation**:
  - Multiple: Comparable companies' EV/EBITDA multiples (e.g., 10x)
  - Target EBITDA: $50M × 10x = $500M valuation
  - Discounted cash flow: Project 5 years, discount at 10% WACC
  - Precedent transactions: Compare to recent similar deals
  
- **Synergy Analysis**:
  - Revenue synergies: Cross-sell opportunities, pricing power
  - Cost synergies: Eliminate overlap, procurement leverage
  - Working capital: Potential release of cash
  - Quantify: How much $ benefit? How certain?
  - Timeline: When do synergies occur?
  
- **Accretion/Dilution**:
  - Accretion: Deal increases EPS (profit per share)
  - Dilution: Deal decreases EPS
  - Formula: (Acquired EBITDA × multiple - Interest) ÷ Combined shares
  - Important for stock deals
  
- **Risks**:
  - Integration: Culture, systems, people
  - Customer retention: Customers may leave
  - Hidden liabilities: Legal, compliance, environmental
  - Execution: Ability to deliver promised results
  
- **Deal Structure**:
  - All cash: Higher cost but simpler
  - Stock: Lower cost but dilutes existing shareholders
  - Earnout: Contingent payment based on future results
