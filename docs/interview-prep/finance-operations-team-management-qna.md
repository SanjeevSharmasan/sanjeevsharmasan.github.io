## For Senior Manager & Director Level

---

### 1. TEAM STRUCTURE & ORGANIZATION

**Q: How would you structure a finance operations team for O2C, AP, and collections?**
A:
- **Small Team** (1-5 people, <$50M revenue):
  - 1 AP/P2P: Process invoices, payments
  - 1 AR/O2C: Invoicing, AR maintenance
  - 1 Collections: Follow-up on past due
  - 1 Part-time: Reconciliation, month-end close
  - Manager: You handle compliance, strategy, process improvement
  
- **Medium Team** (5-15 people, $50M-500M revenue):
  - AP Lead: Manage 2-3 AP clerks
  - AR Lead: Manage 2-3 AR clerks
  - Collections Manager: Manage 3-5 collectors
  - Sr. Analyst: Automation, system configuration
  - Accountant: GL reconciliation, reporting
  - You: Strategy, system improvements, cross-training, compliance
  
- **Large Team** (15+ people, $500M+ revenue):
  - AP Supervisor (team of 5-8)
  - AR Supervisor (team of 5-8)
  - Collections Manager (team of 8-12)
  - Automation/RPA Lead (2-3 people)
  - Shared Services Support (3-5)
  - Sr. Accountant: Metrics, analytics, reporting
  - You: Overall strategy, process governance, system roadmap, cost management
  
- **By Geography** (Global operations):
  - Regional centers (India, Philippines, Poland) for offshore AR/AP
  - Follow-the-sun coverage: India handles Asia-Pac, Europe, Americas morning
  - Onshore for complex issues, VIP customers, escalations
  - Central governance: Policies, quality standards, metrics dashboard

**Q: How do you think about team sizing and headcount planning?**
A:
- **Capacity Planning**:
  - Invoices per month: # of invoices processed
  - Capacity per person: 500-800 invoices/month (AP)
  - Headcount needed: Total invoices ÷ Capacity per person
  - Example: 100K invoices/month ÷ 600 per person = 167 people (without automation)
  
- **With Automation**:
  - RPA handles 50% of invoices: 100K × 50% = 50K manual
  - 50K ÷ 600 = 83 people
  - Savings: 84 people × $60K salary = $5M annual benefit
  
- **Service Levels**:
  - Standard processing: 2-3 days
  - Urgent: Same day
  - Staffing: Higher volume periods may need temp staff or overtime
  - Escalations: Reserve capacity for exceptions
  
- **Benchmarking**:
  - AR: 1 person per $2-3M in AR
  - AP: 1 person per 400-500 invoices/month
  - Collections: 1 person per $1-2M in collections portfolio
  - Your reality: Compare to benchmarks, understand why different

  - Symptoms: May be personal issues (burnout, family situation)
  
- **Initial Conversation**:
  - Private, non-accusatory: "I've noticed X... what's going on?"
  - Listen: Maybe they're overwhelmed, system is down, or need help
  - Root cause: Is it skill gap? Resources? Personal issue? Attitude?
  - Example: "I see your error rate is 4%, usually 1%. Are you struggling with X, or is something else going on?"

  - **Coaching**: "I noticed you applied the payment to the wrong invoice. Let's walk through the matching logic again so you understand the process better"
  
  - **Redirecting**: "Your spreadsheet is well-organized, but the boss needs it in PowerPoint format. Can you convert it by EOD tomorrow?"
