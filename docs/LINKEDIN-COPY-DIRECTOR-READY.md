## LINKEDIN ABOUT/SUMMARY (Use This - 3-4 Paragraphs)

### **Full Summary (Copy & Paste)**

---

**I build and scale global finance operations that deliver measurable business impact.**

Over 21+ years in global finance, I've transformed how organizations manage Order-to-Cash, Accounts Receivable, and Credit operations. My career has been defined by one clear principle: **organize for scale, automate for impact, measure everything.**

**My Founder Story**

In 2015, I took on a greenfield assignment at Cargill: build a scalable O2C shared services organization in Bangalore supporting EMEA, Japan, and APAC from zero. Think of it as launching a startup inside a Fortune 500 company—with all the complexity of multi-country compliance, currency diversity, and stakeholder alignment, but with the ambition of a founder.

What started as a concept became a **$500M+ revenue support machine:**
- Built a 60-member global team across onshore/offshore locations
- Designed and scaled end-to-end O2C processes (billing, AR, cash application, collections, credit, disputes)
- Led SAP JDE → S/4HANA transformation across 25 EMEA countries with zero disruption
- Delivered $10M+ working capital impact (DSO: 51→42 days, -18%)
- Scaled automation from 60%→87% through RPA and intelligent process automation
- Achieved 99% billing accuracy, 98% cash application accuracy, zero audit findings

**Why This Matters**

That founder mentality—thinking like a business owner, obsessed with ROI and efficiency, comfortable with ambiguity, driven to build something world-class—is what I bring to every role. I don't just manage processes; I transform them. I don't just lead teams; I develop next-generation leaders. I don't just optimize costs; I unlock cash flow and competitive advantage.

**What I Do Best**

✓ **Strategic O2C/AR Leadership:** End-to-end function ownership, P&L accountability, CFO-level partnership  
✓ **Global Operating Model Design:** Standardization + local compliance, shared services optimization  
✓ **Enterprise Transformation:** ERP migrations ($12M+ budgets), RPA automation, process redesign  
✓ **Outsourcing Partnership Management:** SLA governance, performance incentives, partnership expansion  
✓ **Team Building & Development:** Built 60-person organizations, promoted internal leaders, fostered accountability  
✓ **Financial Data Excellence:** SOX compliance, zero audit findings, real-time KPI dashboards (Power BI)  
✓ **AI & Automation Enablement:** GenAI-assisted workflows, RPA (Serrala AutoBank), intelligent process automation  

**Background**

- **Cargill (10+ years):** FinOps Manager, built and scaled O2C organization across 25 countries
- **Oracle (11.5 years):** Finance Operations Leader, AP/AR/O2C across EMEA & JAPAC  
- **ENI Merchant Navy (7.5 years):** Supply chain & operations background—where I learned that financial operations exist to serve the business, and efficiency drives profitability

**Education**
- Executive Program in Strategy Management (IIM Kashipur)
- MBA Finance (Rai University)
- M.Sc. IT, B.Sc. IT (Kuvempu University)
- JLPT Level 4, Supply Chain Certification

**Languages:** Hindi (Native) | English (Fluent) | Japanese (Professional) | Greek (Professional)

**What's Next**

At the Director level, I'm positioned to own end-to-end O2C/AR/Credit/Collections strategy for a global organization, drive enterprise transformation, manage outsourcing partnerships as a true strategic partner, and build organizations that deliver world-class results.

**Open to:** Director-level roles in O2C/AR/Credit/Collections at Fortune 500, Big 4 consulting, global shared services, or private equity-backed organizations.

**Let's Connect:** If you're building a world-class finance operations team or leading a transformation, I'd love to explore how I can help. 🎯
