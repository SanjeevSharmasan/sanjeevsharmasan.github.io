## 💡 THE CORE STRATEGY

**Problem:** 5-month gap (Aug 2025 - Jan 2026)

**Old Approach:** Explain it, apologize, hope they overlook it  
**New Approach:** **Rebrand as founder story** ✅

**Your Narrative:**
> "I left Cargill in August 2025 after transforming $500M+ of Order-to-Cash processes. I identified a market gap: every finance team has O2C problems, but no focused solutions exist. So I started CashFlow Labs to build 5 micro-tools for the 5 pillars of O2C. MVP launches Q1 2026. We're actively seeking pilot partners."

**Result:** Companies don't see a gap. They see a founder solving a real problem.
