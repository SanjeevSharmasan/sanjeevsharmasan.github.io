## 📖 Interview Examples

### **Example 1: "Walk me through the O2C process"**

**What to Cover** (in order):
1. Order capture (EDI, SAP portal, email)
2. Order validation (credit check, inventory, pricing)
3. Order fulfillment (picking, packing, shipping)
4. Billing (automatic invoice generation)
5. AR posting (customer account)
6. Collections (if not paid)
7. Cash application (payment posting)
8. Reconciliation (GL ↔ subledger)

**Add Details:**
- Cycle time: "Typical 45-60 days, can be reduced to 30-35 days"
- Key KPI: "DSO is critical - currently 40 days, targeting 32"
- System: "In SAP: VA01 for order, VF01 for invoice, FI-AR for posting"
- Improvement: "We invoiced at delivery before; now invoice at shipment → 5-day improvement"

---

### **Example 2: "How would you reduce our DSO from 45 days to 35 days?"**

**Quick Wins (1-3 months):**
1. **Invoicing speed**: Invoice at shipment, not delivery → 3-5 days
2. **Automated dunning**: Emails at 1/5/15 days → 3-5 days
3. **Payment options**: Add ACH, credit card → 2-3 days
4. **Top account contact**: Personal outreach to top 20 customers → 3-5 days

**Mid-term (3-6 months):**
5. **Early pay discount**: 1% discount to pay in 10 days (if cash allows)
6. **Process standardization**: Consistent invoices, payment instructions
7. **Customer segmentation**: Different terms for different risk

**Long-term (6-12 months):**
8. **System upgrade**: S/4HANA with real-time analytics
9. **Advance billing**: For subscriptions, invoice at start of period
10. **Customer quality**: Shift toward more creditworthy customers

**Expected outcome**: 15-20 day improvement is realistic

---

### **Example 3: "Explain 3-way matching and its importance"**

**What It Is:**
- Compares Invoice against PO (quantity, price) and GR (receipt confirmation)
- System blocks if variance exceeds tolerance (typically ±2-5%)

**Why It Matters:**
1. **Prevents overpayment**: Vendor can't invoice for more than ordered
2. **Catches errors**: Identifies qty discrepancies, pricing mistakes
3. **Fraud prevention**: Ensures goods were actually received before payment
4. **Efficiency**: Reduces manual review and exception handling

**The Flow:**
1. PO created for 100 units @ $10 = $1,000
2. Goods receipt confirms 95 units arrived (variance!)
3. Vendor invoices for 100 units @ $10 = $1,000
4. System blocks: "GR shows 95 units but invoice is 100"
5. Requires manual review: Call vendor, resolve discrepancy

**KPI Impact:**
- Accuracy: >95% of invoices match without exception
- Cost: Matching done automatically (not manual review)
- Fraud: Eliminates many fraud schemes

---

### **Example 4: "How do you optimize payment terms?"**

**Current State:**
- Paying vendors in 30 days on average
- DPO (Days Payable Outstanding) = 30 days

**Analysis:**
- Which vendors could pay in 60 days? (lower risk, established suppliers)
- Which offer early pay discounts? (2/10 Net 30 = 36.5% ROI!)

**Strategy:**
1. **Extend with key vendors**: Negotiate 60 days for loyal, stable vendors
   - Benefit: Improves DPO from 30 to 40 days = 10 days cash freed up
   - Risk: Must maintain relationships, suppliers may increase prices
   
2. **Take early pay discounts** when cash allows:
   - 2% off to pay in 10 days vs. 30 days
   - ROI: 2% × (365 ÷ 20) = 36.5% annualized
   - Worth it if we have liquidity
   
3. **Supply chain financing**:
   - Vendor can sell invoice to bank at 95% value
   - Buyer still pays on day 60 per agreement
   - Vendor gets early cash without us paying

**Impact on Cash Flow:**
- If we have $1M monthly spend, extending DPO by 10 days = $333K cash freed up!

---

### **Example 5: "What's the difference between budget and forecast?"**

**Budget:**
- **What**: Annual plan of what we intend to achieve
- **When**: Set once per year (e.g., in June for next fiscal year)
- **Flexibility**: Fixed for the year (or quarterly updates)
- **Use**: Accountability, assess performance against plan
- **Example**: "We budgeted $100M revenue for the year"

**Forecast:**
- **What**: Realistic expectation of what we'll actually achieve
- **When**: Updated monthly or quarterly
- **Flexibility**: Flexible, updated frequently with actuals
- **Use**: Decision-making, identify issues early
- **Example**: "Q1 actual $25M + Q2 outlook = expecting $95M, not $100M"

**Rolling Forecast:**
- **Hybrid**: Maintains 12-month forward view always
- **Example**: In February, forecast Feb 2026 - Jan 2027
- **Better**: More agile than static annual budget
- **Growing in popularity**: Especially in fast-moving industries

**In Practice:**
- Budget variance (Actual vs. Budget): Tells you planning was wrong
- Forecast variance (Actual vs. Forecast): Tells you current execution is off
- Forecast accuracy: Better metric to monitor (>80% target)

✅ Invoice at shipment (not delivery) for faster DSO

### **AP/P2P**
✅ 3-way match: PO vs. Invoice vs. GR
✅ DPO optimization: Extend terms (improve cash) while maintaining relationships
✅ Early pay discount ROI: 2/10 Net 30 = 36.5% annualized

### **Collections**
✅ Multi-level: Automated (1-5 days) → Personal (30 days) → Escalation (60+)
✅ Don't hold 100% payment on partial disputes
✅ Focus on top 20% of AR (represents 50% of value)

### **Billing**
✅ ASC 606: Recognize revenue when performance obligation satisfied (not when billed)
✅ Billing timing ≠ Revenue recognition timing
✅ Different models: Transaction, subscription, usage, milestone, advance

### **FP&A**
✅ CCC = DIO + DSO - DPO (lower is better, negative is best)
✅ Budget (plan), Forecast (expected), Rolling Forecast (always 12-month forward)
