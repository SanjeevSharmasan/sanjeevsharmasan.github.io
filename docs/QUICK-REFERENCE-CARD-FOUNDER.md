🚀 FOUNDER | Building the future of Order-to-Cash

After 12 years optimizing $500M+ Order-to-Cash processes at Cargill, 
I identified a market opportunity: every finance team has the same 
O2C challenges, but no focused solutions exist.

At CashFlow Labs, we're building 5 micro-tools for 5 O2C pillars:

✓ Invoice Intelligence (AI-powered recognition)
✓ Credit Risk (Real-time scoring)
✓ Collections (AI-driven predictions)
✓ Cash Applications (Smart matching)
✓ Disputes (Automated resolution)

MVP: Q1 2026 | Status: Actively seeking pilot partners

If your company struggles with manual invoicing, DSO, or collections—
let's talk.
```

## 📊 THE 5 PILLARS - Quick Reference

| Pillar | Problem | Timeline | Impact |
|--------|---------|----------|--------|
| 1. Invoice | 5-7 days | Q1 2026 (MVP) | 2-3 hours |
| 2. Credit | 3-5 days | Q2 2026 | Instant |
| 3. Collections | DSO 45-60d | Q2 2026 | DSO 8-12d ↓ |
| 4. Cash | Manual/slow | Q3 2026 | 90%+ auto |
| 5. Disputes | 30-90 days | Q3 2026 | 50% faster |

## 💡 COMMON OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES

**"You just left Cargill. Are you experienced enough to build this?"**
→ "I spent 12 years there building $500M+ of automation. I know this space inside-out. That's why I left—to apply that knowledge to solve the market's problems."

**"Why should we work with a startup vs an established vendor?"**
→ "Because established vendors built bloated solutions 10 years ago. We're building focused tools for today's problems. Plus, you'll get to shape the product with us."

**"How do we know you'll succeed?"**
→ "Fair question. Here's what we have: A founder with 12 years of proven domain expertise, 20+ validated customer interviews, MVP in development, and proven ability to deliver at scale. We're looking for pilot partners to help us launch Q1 2026."

**"What's your pricing?"**
→ "Early adopter pricing is $5K-$8K/month per module. Full pricing TBD based on customer feedback during pilots. Want to be a pilot partner?"

## 📲 SOCIAL MEDIA POSTING TEMPLATE

**Every post should follow this structure:**

```
[HOOK - Get attention in first line]

[PROBLEM - Show you understand their pain]

[DATA - Provide proof/statistics]

[YOUR STORY - Share your experience]

[SOLUTION - What you're building]

[CTA - Call to action (question or link)]

[HASHTAGS - 3-5 relevant tags]
```

**Example:**
```
Most finance teams are still using manual O2C processes.

And it's costing them.

→ 5-7 days to process invoices
→ 45-60 days DSO
→ 40 hours/week of manual work
→ 2-3% error rate

After automating $500M+ of this at Cargill, 
I realized the entire market has the same problem.

So I'm building CashFlow Labs—5 micro-tools 
for the 5 pillars of Order-to-Cash.

MVP launches Q1 2026.

Which O2C pillar would give your company the biggest impact?
→ Invoice processing?
→ Collections?
→ Credit decisions?
