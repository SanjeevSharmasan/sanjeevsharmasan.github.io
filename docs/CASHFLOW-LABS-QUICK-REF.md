## 🎤 30-SECOND PITCH (Memorize This)

```
"I'm Sanjeev. Founder of CashFlow Labs.

12 years at Cargill: $500M+ automation, 85-95% efficiency, $8-10M savings.

Every company has 3 O2C problems:
1. DSO too high (millions stuck)
2. Credit approvals too slow (3-5 days)
3. Cash matching too manual (poor visibility)

Building AI solutions for these 3.

Q1 2026 launch. Seeking pilot partners.

Does your company struggle with any of these?"

## 📝 FIRST LINKEDIN POST (Copy & Publish)

```
CFOs are losing sleep over this: DSO.

Days Sales Outstanding.

Reality: $100M revenue = $12-20M tied up at 45-60 day DSO

At Cargill, we fixed this using data, not gut feel.

Instead of:
❌ Random collection calls
❌ Spreadsheet tracking
❌ Celebrate any improvement

We did:
✅ Predict what works per customer
✅ Optimize contact timing (ML-based)
✅ Segment strategies
✅ Measure continuously

Result: 8-12 day DSO reduction

$5-10M freed up working capital (for $500M company).

We're building this at CashFlow Labs.
