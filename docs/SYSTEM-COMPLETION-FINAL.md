## 💡 KEY INTERVIEW STORIES TO PREPARE (From New Content)

### **Cash Applications & Collections**

### **Team Management & Leadership**
*Example Story:* "I built an AP team from scratch, hired 8 people with the right attitude and trained them on SAP ECC and Serrala. We went from chaos to 95% STP rate in 12 months. Zero turnover and 100% engagement scores."

### **Stakeholder Management**
*Example Story:* "Sales wanted extended payment terms to 60 days for a strategic customer. I analyzed their financials, proposed 45 days with quarterly reviews, and presented the working capital impact to CFO. Everyone was satisfied."

### **CFO Partnership**
*Example Story:* "I identified an RPA opportunity for AP invoice processing. I built a business case showing $300K investment with $450K 3-year ROI and 12-month payback. Got CFO approval in 2 weeks and delivered on time under budget."
