Hi [Name],

- Invoice Intelligence (AI-powered recognition)
- Credit Risk (Real-time scoring)
- Collections Optimizer (AI-driven predictions)
- Cash Application (Smart matching)

We're launching Q1 2026 and actively seeking pilot partners.

Quick question: Which of these challenges is most painful for 
your company right now?
- Manual invoice processing

---

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ **DON'T:** Keep it vague ("working on startup stuff")
✅ **DO:** Be specific ("Building AI-powered invoice intelligence")

❌ **DON'T:** Hide the gap (explain why you left)
✅ **DO:** Showcase the gap (this is your founder story)

❌ **DON'T:** Wait to be "perfect" before reaching out
✅ **DO:** Get your story right, then be aggressive with outreach

❌ **DON'T:** Post once and disappear
✅ **DO:** Consistent content (2-3x per week minimum)

❌ **DON'T:** Generic messages to everyone
✅ **DO:** Personalized messages that show you know their business

❌ **DON'T:** Pitch immediately
✅ **DO:** Understand their pain first, then propose solutions

---

## 📞 IF SOMEONE ASKS: "So what are you up to now?"

**Bad Answer:**
"Uh... I'm working on starting something... exploring entrepreneurship..."

**Good Answer:**
"I'm the founder of CashFlow Labs. We're building AI-powered solutions for Order-to-Cash—specifically for the 5 pillars that every enterprise finance team struggles with. I left Cargill in August after successfully transforming $500M+ of O2C processes. Now I'm building solutions so other companies can do the same thing. We're launching Q1 2026 and actively seeking pilot partners. Interested in learning more?"

**Best Answer:**
"I'm the founder of CashFlow Labs. Quick question first—does your company struggle with manual invoice processing, DSO challenges, or collections efficiency? If so, I might have exactly what you need."

[Then listen. Build the conversation around THEIR problem.]

---

## 🎁 YOUR UNFAIR ADVANTAGE

**What most founders DON'T have (but Sanjeev DOES):**
✅ 12 years of deep domain expertise
✅ Track record of solving at scale ($500M+)
✅ Clear market validation (20+ interviews done)
✅ Specific product roadmap (5 pillars, MVP in dev)
✅ Founder credibility (left security for this)
✅ Clear customer profile (know exactly who to sell to)

**Use these advantages. They matter.**
